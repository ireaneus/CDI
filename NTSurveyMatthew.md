### **Section I: Prophesies Realized**  
*Chapters 1:1 - 4:11*  

**Chapter 1**  
*In Chapter 1, Matthew* begins with the genealogy of Jesus, tracing His lineage from Abraham to David, from David to the Babylonian exile, and finally to Christ. *Christ was presented as* the Son of David and the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies, emphasizing His human ancestry. *Believers should* recognize Jesus’ human heritage and see Him as the divinely chosen one who came into history to fulfill God’s promises.

**Chapter 2**  
*In Chapter 2, Matthew* records the visit of the Magi, Herod’s attempt to kill Jesus, and the holy family’s flight to Egypt, showing God’s providential protection of His Son. *Christ was presented as* the King of the Jews, born into a world of danger and hostility, yet firmly rooted in humanity. *Believers should* understand that Jesus’ early life was marked by real human threats and experiences, affirming His genuine humanity.

**Chapter 3**  
*In Chapter 3, Matthew* introduces John the Baptist, *The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight!*, who baptizes Jesus. *Christ was presented as* the beloved Son, with all three members of the Godhead present. *Believers should* look to Jesus' example in baptism as a public demonstration of their commitment to serving Him.

**Chapter 4**  
*In Chapter 4, Jesus* is faced with temptations in the wilderness, with Satan twice calling Him the Son of God to intensify His trials. Jesus also begins His public ministry, calling His first disciples. *Christ was presented as* fully human, experiencing temptation yet remaining sinless. *Believers should* carefully examine themselves and pray, *“Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from the evil one.”*

---

### **Section II: Principles Announced**  
*Chapters 4:12 - 7:29*  

**Chapter 5**  
*In Chapter 5, Jesus* delivers His first public sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, teaching the Beatitudes and calling His followers to a deeper, inward righteousness. *Christ was presented as* the fulfillment of the Law. *Believers should* recognize that Christ came to fulfill the Law and to walk in the Spirit, not by the flesh.

**Chapter 6**  
*In Chapter 6, Jesus* addresses hypocrisy, the importance of doing acts of righteousness in secret, and the problem of anxiety. *Christ was presented as* the Son of Man who speaks with authority. *Believers should* “seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness” in all things.

**Chapter 7**  
*In Chapter 7, Jesus* concludes the Sermon on the Mount, addressing judgment, the importance of producing good fruit, and building one’s life on the solid rock of His teachings. *Christ was presented as* the Rock on which we stand, while all other ground is sinking sand. *Believers should* avoid hypocritical judgment, stand firm on the Rock, and nurture their spiritual growth through obedience and a life rooted in God’s Word to produce good fruit.

---

### **Section III: The Power Revealed**  
*Chapters 8:1 - 11:1*  

**Chapter 8**  
*In Chapter 8, Jesus* performs several miraculous healings, beginning with the healing of a leper, a significant act known as a Messianic miracle, as cleansing leprosy was seen as a sign of the Messiah's arrival. He also heals the centurion’s servant and Peter’s mother-in-law, and later calms a storm, demonstrating His authority over both the physical and spiritual realms. *Christ was presented as* the long-awaited Messiah to the Jews, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies like *Isaiah 53:4* (*“Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering”*) and *Isaiah 35:5-6*, which foretold that the Messiah would heal the blind, the lame, and cleanse the diseased. *Believers should* recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies and see that His miracles were evidence of His divine mission, affirming His identity as the promised Savior of Israel.

**Chapter 9**  
*In Chapter 9, Jesus* continues to demonstrate His authority through extraordinary miracles, including raising a synagogue leader’s daughter from the dead and casting out a mute demon. The exorcism of the mute demon is particularly significant as it was recognized in Jewish tradition as a Messianic miracle, since demons could only be expelled if their name was known, and Jesus cast it out effortlessly, an act that could only be attributed to God. *Christ was presented as* the divine Messiah, performing works that revealed His identity and power. *Believers should* acknowledge Jesus' divine power and trust that He is sovereign over all, recognizing that His authority to perform these works validated His claims as the Son of God.

**Chapter 10**  
*In Chapter 10, Jesus* commissions His twelve disciples, instructing them to preach that “the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand” and granting them authority to heal the sick, raise the dead, and cast out demons. He warns them of the challenges they will face, emphasizing that following Him will bring division rather than peace, as He says, *“Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.”* *Christ was presented as* the authoritative and divisive Messiah, whose message of the Kingdom would confront people’s beliefs and force a choice between loyalty to Him and allegiance to the world. *Believers should* understand the cost of discipleship, being prepared to face opposition for the sake of the Kingdom, and proclaim the gospel boldly, even in the face of resistance.

### **Section IV: The Program Explained**  
*Chapters 11:2 - 13:53*  

**Chapter 11**  
*In Chapter 11, Jesus* answers the question from John the Baptist's disciples about His identity by pointing to the miracles He has performed, which demonstrate that He is indeed the Messiah. He then pays tribute to John, declaring him the greatest of those born of women but noting that even the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than John. Jesus also rebukes the cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum for their lack of repentance despite witnessing His mighty works. *Christ was presented as* the “Expected One,” fulfilling prophecies such as *Isaiah 35:5-6* and *Isaiah 61:1*, which described the Messiah’s miracles and His proclamation of good news. *Believers should* recognize Jesus as the promised fulfillment of Old Testament Scripture and take seriously the consequences of those who reject His message, as demonstrated by His warnings to the unrepentant cities.

**Chapter 12**  
*In Chapter 12, Jesus* faces mounting opposition from the Pharisees, who accuse Him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul, marking a significant moment of national rejection of the Son of David. He warns them about the unforgivable sin—blasphemy against the Holy Spirit—and explains that this rejection reflects their hardened hearts and spiritual blindness. From this point forward, Jesus shifts His teaching approach, using parables to reveal truths to His disciples while concealing them from those who reject Him. *Christ was presented as* the rejected Messiah, whose authority and identity were challenged by the religious leaders, fulfilling the prophecy of opposition and signaling a turning point in His ministry. *Believers should* understand the significance of this chapter regarding Israel's rejection of the Messiah and the Kingdom, and be grateful that the offer of the Kingdom is now extended to the Gentiles, embracing the free offer of grace.

**Chapter 13**  
*In Chapter 13, Jesus* begins to teach the crowds using parables, fulfilling the prophecy, *“I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world”* (*Psalm 78:2*). He describes the Kingdom of Heaven through seven parables, including the Parable of the Sower, the Weeds, the Mustard Seed, and the Hidden Treasure, revealing profound spiritual truths to those with eyes to see and ears to hear. *Christ was presented as* the divine teacher and revealer of hidden truths, who wisely separates genuine seekers from the hard-hearted through His use of parables. *Believers should* recognize the privilege of being given insight into the mysteries of the Kingdom and respond with faith and a desire to bear spiritual fruit, understanding that the Kingdom’s message is one of both present grace and future judgment.

### **Section V: The Purpose Declared**  
*Chapters 13:54 - 19:2*  

**Chapter 14**  
*In Chapter 14, Jesus* performs the miracle of feeding the 5,000, the first miraculous feeding mentioned in all four Gospels. Before multiplying the loaves and fish, He tests the faith of His disciples, challenging them to bring their empty baskets to Him, teaching them the necessity of relying on Him for provision. Later, Jesus walks on water and invites Peter to step out of the boat, further testing the disciples’ faith and revealing the power of trusting in His presence. *Christ was presented as* the compassionate provider who meets the needs of the multitude and the sovereign Lord over creation, demonstrating His divine authority. *Believers should* learn to bring their needs and inadequacies to Jesus, trusting in His power to provide and understanding that true faith means continually depending on Him, even in life’s storms.

**Chapter 15**  
*In Chapter 15, Jesus* rebukes the Pharisees by using the analogy of “cleaning the outside of the cup” while neglecting the impurity of the heart, exposing their focus on external appearances over true inner holiness. Later, a Gentile woman approaches Jesus, pleading for the healing of her daughter, and humbly responds to Jesus’ statement about His mission to Israel by saying, “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” Her great faith is honored, and Jesus heals her daughter, demonstrating that God’s mercy and grace extend even to those considered outsiders. *Christ was presented as* the compassionate Savior who honors genuine faith, even from those outside the Jewish nation, revealing the inclusivity of His mission. *Believers should* praise God for His grace that extends beyond the boundaries of Israel, recognizing that He has not forgotten those who once did not know Him and that His mercy reaches all who come to Him in faith.

**Chapter 16**  
*In Chapter 16, Jesus* responds to the Pharisees and Sadducees who demand a sign, stating that *“no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah,”* referring to His future resurrection after three days and three nights. He warns His disciples about the *“leaven”* of the Pharisees and Sadducees, symbolizing the corrupting influence of their false teachings. Jesus then reveals to His disciples the coming suffering, death, and resurrection. *Christ is presented as* the Messiah, affirmed by Peter’s declaration, *“You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”* *Believers should* “deny themselves and take up their cross,” emphasizing the cost of true discipleship, and they are warned to guard against the spiritual corruption of false teachers.

**Chapter 17**  
*In Chapter 17, Matthew* describes the Transfiguration of Jesus, where His face shines like the sun and His clothes become as white as light. Moses and Elijah appear beside Him, and a voice from the cloud declares, *“This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to Him,”* affirming Jesus' divine authority and His fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. Jesus then heals a demon-possessed boy whom the disciples could not cure, emphasizing the necessity of even a small amount of genuine faith in the Son of God, and He again predicts His death and resurrection.*Christ is presented as* the majestic and glorious King, who reigns with divine authority over all creation. *Believers should* recognize this moment as a powerful confirmation of Jesus' true identity and honor Him as the Sovereign King who fulfills God’s redemptive plan.

**Chapter 18**  
*In Chapter 18, Jesus* commands His disciples to be like children, saying, *“Unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”* He issues a stern warning against causing *“one of these little ones”* to stumble. Jesus presents the parable of the lost sheep, where the shepherd leaves the ninety-nine to find the one that is lost. He also provides instructions for handling offenses within the church, emphasizing reconciliation and forgiveness, and concludes with the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, teaching the necessity of extending the same mercy we have received. *Christ is presented as* the compassionate and protective Shepherd, who values every individual and seeks to bring the lost back into His fold. *Believers should* embody childlike humility, take sin seriously, seek to reconcile broken relationships, and forgive others from the heart, just as God has forgiven them.


### **Section VI: The Problems Presented**  
*Chapters 19:3 - 26:2*  

**Chapter 19**  
*In Chapter 19, Matthew conveys* the examination of Jesus as the spotless Lamb, drawing a parallel to the four-day testing of the Passover lamb before the sacrifice. The Pharisees challenge Him with questions about divorce, but despite their efforts, they find no fault in His responses, as His wisdom is unassailable. Jesus then emphasizes humility, welcoming little children and teaching His disciples that true greatness in the Kingdom comes from a childlike heart and the willingness to serve, as they are destined to reign with Him on twelve thrones. *Christ is presented as* the spotless Lamb, whose perfection endures every test by human intellect and religious scrutiny. *Believers should* embrace humility, serve with selflessness, and understand that the path to greatness in God’s Kingdom is marked by a childlike faith and a heart devoted to service.

**Chapter 20**  
Jesus tells the parable of the workers in the vineyard, illustrating God’s grace in rewarding His followers. He predicts His suffering for the third time and addresses the disciples’ desire for greatness, teaching that true greatness is found in servanthood. The chapter concludes with Jesus healing two blind men, who call Him the Son of David, acknowledging His messianic role.  

**Chapter 21**  
Jesus enters Jerusalem triumphantly on a donkey, fulfilling Zechariah’s prophecy and symbolizing His kingship. He cleanses the temple, driving out the merchants and declaring it a house of prayer, and curses the fig tree, a symbolic act against fruitless religion. Jesus teaches parables that expose the religious leaders’ hypocrisy and foretell God’s judgment.  

**Chapter 22**  
The Pharisees and Sadducees question Jesus about taxes, the resurrection, and the greatest commandment, but He answers with divine wisdom. He declares the greatest commandment to be love for God and neighbor, summing up the Law. Jesus also challenges their understanding of the Messiah, silencing His opponents and affirming His authority.  

**Chapter 23**  
Jesus denounces the religious leaders with a series of woes, condemning their hypocrisy, pride, and oppression of the people. He laments over Jerusalem, expressing sorrow for their rejection of God’s prophets and foretelling the city’s desolation. The chapter serves as a strong warning against religious pretense and a call to genuine repentance.  

**Chapter 24**  
Jesus prophesies the destruction of the temple and describes signs of the end times, warning His disciples to be watchful and prepared. He speaks of wars, persecution, and the coming of the Son of Man, emphasizing the necessity of vigilance. Jesus’ teaching underscores the certainty of His return and the need for faithfulness in awaiting His Kingdom.  

**Chapter 25**  
Jesus tells three parables about the end times: the ten virgins, the talents, and the sheep and goats, each emphasizing readiness and stewardship. The parable of the ten virgins highlights the importance of spiritual preparedness, while the talents call for faithful service. The chapter concludes with the final judgment, where acts of love and compassion reveal genuine faith.

### **Section VII: The Passion Accomplished**  
*Chapters 26:3 - 28:10*  

**Chapter 26**  
The plot against Jesus unfolds as Judas agrees to betray Him, and Jesus celebrates the Last Supper, instituting the practice of communion. In Gethsemane, Jesus prays in agony, submitting to the Father’s will, and is arrested after Judas' betrayal. The chapter ends with Peter’s denial and Jesus being brought before the high priest, fulfilling His predictions of suffering.  

**Chapter 27**  
Jesus stands trial before Pilate, is mocked, and sentenced to crucifixion, fulfilling prophecy as the suffering Servant. He is crucified at Golgotha, and His death is marked by supernatural signs, including darkness and the tearing of the temple curtain. Jesus is buried in a guarded tomb, but His death paves the way for the ultimate act of redemption.  

**Chapter 28**  
On the third day, Jesus rises from the dead, appearing first to the women at the tomb and commissioning them to tell the disciples. The religious leaders bribe the guards to spread a false report, but Jesus meets His disciples in Galilee. The chapter concludes with the Great Commission, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, assuring them of His presence.

### **Epilogue: The Great Commission**  
*Chapters 28:11 - 20*  

**Chapter 28 (Summary)**  
Jesus’ resurrection triumphs over sin and death, confirming His divinity and authority. He commissions His disciples to spread the gospel and baptize believers, promising to be with them always. The book ends with this powerful charge, emphasizing Jesus' sovereign reign and the mission of His Church.
