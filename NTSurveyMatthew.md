**Chapter 3**  
*In Chapter 3, Matthew* introduces John the Baptist, *The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight!*, who baptizes Jesus. *Christ was presented as* the beloved Son, with all three members of the Godhead present. *Believers should* look to Jesus' example in baptism as a public demonstration of their commitment to serving Him.

**Chapter 4**  
*In Chapter 4, Jesus* is faced with temptations in the wilderness, with Satan twice calling Him the Son of God to intensify His trials. Jesus also begins His public ministry, calling His first disciples. *Christ was presented as* fully human, experiencing temptation yet remaining sinless. *Believers should* carefully examine themselves and pray, *“Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from the evil one.”*

*Chapters 4:12 - 7:29*  

**Chapter 5**  
*In Chapter 5, Jesus* delivers His first public sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, teaching the Beatitudes and calling His followers to a deeper, inward righteousness. *Christ was presented as* the fulfillment of the Law. *Believers should* recognize that Christ came to fulfill the Law and to walk in the Spirit, not by the flesh.

**Chapter 6**  
*In Chapter 6, Jesus* addresses hypocrisy, the importance of doing acts of righteousness in secret, and the problem of anxiety. *Christ was presented as* the Son of Man who speaks with authority. *Believers should* “seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness” in all things.

**Chapter 7**  
*In Chapter 7, Jesus* concludes the Sermon on the Mount, addressing judgment, the importance of producing good fruit, and building one’s life on the solid rock of His teachings. *Christ was presented as* the Rock on which we stand, while all other ground is sinking sand. *Believers should* avoid hypocritical judgment, stand firm on the Rock, and nurture their spiritual growth through obedience and a life rooted in God’s Word to produce good fruit.

*Chapters 8:1 - 11:1*  

**Chapter 8**  
*In Chapter 8, Jesus* performs several significant Messianic miracles, including healing a leper, which was seen as a sign of the Messiah's coming. He calms a storm and casts out demons, demonstrating His authority over both the natural and spiritual realms, and tests the faith of His disciples as they learn to trust in His power. *Christ was presented as* the long-awaited Messiah to the Jews, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. *Believers should* recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies and see that His miracles were evidence of His divine mission, affirming His identity as the promised Savior of Israel.

**Chapter 9**

He also calls Matthew, a tax collector, to be His disciple, emphasizing the inclusivity of His mission and the power of spiritual and physical restoration. *Christ was presented as* the divine Messiah, performing works that revealed His identity and power. *Believers should* acknowledge Jesus' divine power and trust that He is sovereign over all, recognizing that His authority to perform these works validated His claims as the Son of God.

*Chapters 11:2 - 13:53*  


**Chapter 11**  
*In Chapter 11, Jesus* reassures John the Baptist that He is indeed the Messiah by pointing to His miraculous works. He condemns unrepentant cities for rejecting His message and invites those burdened and weary to find rest in Him, showing both judgment and compassion. *Christ was presented as* the “Expected One,” fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. *Believers should* recognize Jesus as the promised fulfillment of Old Testament Scripture and take seriously the consequences of those who reject His message, as demonstrated by His warnings to the unrepentant cities.

**Chapter 12**  
*In Chapter 12, Jesus* faces intensified rejection from the Pharisees, who accuse Him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul. He warns them of the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, a sin rooted in Israel's national rejection of Him as the Christ. Jesus marks this as a pivotal moment, shifting to parables as He continues to confront unbelief. *Christ was presented as* the rejected Messiah, whose authority and identity were challenged by the religious leaders. *Believers should* rejoice in the significance of this chapter, understanding Israel's rejection of the Messiah and the Kingdom, and be thankful that the offer of the Kingdom is now extended to the Gentiles, embracing the generous, free gift of grace.

**Chapter 13**  
*In Chapter 13, Jesus* uses parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, unveiling hidden truths and distinguishing genuine seekers from the hard-hearted. This separation reflects God’s sovereign grace, as the gospel is revealed to the humble and concealed from the proud. *Christ is presented as* the Pearl of Great Price, whose worth surpasses all else. *Believers should* recognize the immense value of the Kingdom and the great sacrifice Christ made, responding with gratitude and whole-hearted devotion as bondservants of Christ.

**Chapter 21**  
Jesus enters Jerusalem triumphantly on a donkey, fulfilling Zechariah’s prophecy and symbolizing His kingship. He cleanses the temple, driving out the merchants and declaring it a house of prayer, and curses the fig tree, a symbolic act against fruitless religion. Jesus teaches parables that expose the religious leaders’ hypocrisy and foretell God’s judgment.  

**Chapter 22**  
The Pharisees and Sadducees question Jesus about taxes, the resurrection, and the greatest commandment, but He answers with divine wisdom.
