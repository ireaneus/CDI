Review

- The common title *“Old Testament,”* better termed *“The Hebrew Scriptures?”*
- The terms are interchangeable. *“Old”* doesn’t mean outdated.

Preview

- We will look at the way the Hebrew Scriptures are divided.
- Assignment: Recite the 39 books of the OT. Learn the Hebrew order.

Hebrew Scriptures

- 2 Timothy 2:15 speaks of *“rightly dividing the Word of Truth.”*
- Become experts in the use of the Bible as we *“hold out the word of life.”* Philippians 2:16

### Traditional Septuagint Division

- 39 books divided into 5 basic categories:

1. **Five books of Moses**: *Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy*.
2. **Twelve books of History**: *Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings, 1-2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther*.
3. **Five books of Poetry**: *Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon*.
4. **Five Major Prophets**: *Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel*.
5. **The Twelve Prophets**: *Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi*.

- This arrangement came from the Septuagint (LXX), a Greek translation of the Jewish Scriptures produced in the Alexandria, Egypt in the 3rd century BC.
- These divisions follow a certain logical pattern both historical and literary.
- These books were verified as the Jewish canon of Scripture hundreds of years before the coming of Messiah and the writing of the New Testament.

### The Tanakh

- A more ancient arrangement of the Jewish Scriptures is the Tanakh.
- The Tanakh is an acronym for a three-fold division verified by Jesus in Luke 24:44, *“Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses (Torah), the Prophets (Neviim), and the Psalms (Ketuviim – writings).”*
- The letters T-N-K are pronounced TaNaKh (Ta-knock).
- The Tanakh also follows a logical, historical and literary pattern.
- Three-fold division:

1. **Torah (the Law)**: *Genesis-Deuteronomy, the Books of Moses*.
2. **Neviim (the Prophets) – 8 books**: *Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, The Twelve (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi)*.

- The first 4 books don’t carry the same sense of being *“prophetic”* as Isaiah – the Twelve. They contain the stories of Elijah, Elisha, etc. who brought God’s Word to warn, instruct and convict.
- The one book of the Minor Prophets does not lessen their uniqueness, nor hint at common human authorship.
- The logical explanation is that, because of their size, they were combined into one book so as not to lose track of any of them.

3. **Ketuviim (the Writings)**: *Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth,Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles*.

- Daniel deserves recognition as a Major Prophetic work, however, much of Daniel is historical narrative and not *“prophetic.”*
- The 12 chapters of Daniel and the time-frame of action may have led to its inclusion in the Writings with Esther and Ezra-Nehemiah.
- In the Writings the primary literary style is Hebrew poetry.
- The final 4 books are primarily narrative but *“post-exilic.”*
- Ezra-Nehemiah comprise one book not separated until after Christ.
- In this Old Testament survey we will be following the arrangement of the Hebrew Scriptures found in the Tanakh. This lends to the understanding of the Bible that Jesus read and preached from.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will consider the use of types and symbols in the Scriptures.
- These literary devices point to Christ.
- The Old Testament is filled with hints, impressions and pictures of a coming Savior. *“These are the Scriptures that testify about me.”* John 5:39
