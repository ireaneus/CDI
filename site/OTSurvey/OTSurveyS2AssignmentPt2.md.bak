**Begin video.**

Preview

- We will consider the Scriptures’ use of types, shadows, signs and symbols, preparing God’s people to recognize Jesus as the Messiah.
- Much of this will be a review of the Bibliology course session on *“Typology.”*

Defining Types and Shadows, Signs and Symbols:

- A *“type”* (Greek, Tupos), is and Old Testament person, place, thing or occurrence that prefigures a person, place, thing or occurrence found in the New Testament. The Greek word is translated *“example”* or *“pattern.”*
- The corresponding New Testament person, place, thing or occurrence is called the *“antitype.”*
- *“Shadow”* is a word throughout the Scriptures indicating the presence of something likely unseen which nevertheless produces an effect on one’s sense of security.
- *“Signs”* are often seen in Scripture (over 100 references). These are objects or occurrences *“which indicate the existence or approach of something else”* (Webster).
- *“Symbols”* may be objects or persons which carry a certain meaning, *“the sign or representation of any moral thing by the images or properties of natural things”* (Webster).
- Symbolic language is common in all types of literature.

Scriptural Examples  
Types:

- Moses was cautioned in the construction of the Tabernacle and its various parts to be careful *“to make them according to the pattern (Hebrew tabniyth), shown you on the mountain.”* **Exodus 25:40**. This instruction is repeated several times indicating the importance of accurately producing a representation of the original. When the writer of Hebrews references this passage he uses the equivalent Greek word for *“pattern”* - tupos, or *“type.”*
- The effect of a *“type”* is the leaving or making of a deep impression that primarily points to Christ or truths about Christ.
- Paul refers to the events of the Israelite’s years of wandering as *“examples (types), to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.”* **1 Corinthians 10:6**
- Events intended to leave deep impressions on God’s chosen people in His purpose to protect the line of descent from which Christ would come.
- The unique meaning of a particular *“person, place, thing or occurrence,”* is often implied and sometimes specifically noted.
- *“Strong”* types are those most clearly pointing to Messiah.
- *“Weak”* types that lead us to think of the Messiah only in certain points in their occurrence.
- *“Antithetical”* types, portray the opposite of what or who Christ would be.
- Joseph is an example of a strong type of Christ.
- A weak type could be Solomon who, in his God-given wisdom pre-figures Christ, *“…in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”* **(Colossians 2:3)**. Yet Solomon’s life was not consistently wise.
- In **Romans 5:14**, Paul says that Adam *“is a pattern [type], of him [Christ], who was to come.”* This is an example of an antithetical type, Adam’s disobedience being the opposite of Christ’s obedience.

Shadows:

- The Hebrew term *“tsale”* and the Greek *“skia”*, both translated *“shadow.”*
- Both words describe unseen realities as in *“the shadow of the Almighty.”* **(Psalm 91:1)**, and *“The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming.”* **Hebrews 10:1**
- This usage invites a deeper consideration of invisible truths.

Signs

- Scripturally, signs carry significant weight as they point to truths God would have us recognize and obey.
- God, the Creator, set the sun, moon and stars in the sky and said, *“let them be for signs, and for seasons and for days and for year”* **(Genesis 1:14)**. These mark the passage of time.
- Throughout Scripture signs are primarily those things that point toward the coming Promised One and at his arrival announced his presence.

Review

- In continuing with this overview of the Hebrew Scriptures we will be particularly concerned with recognizing Jesus in types and shadows, symbols and signs for it was He who said, *“these are the Scriptures that testify about me.”* **John 5:39**
- Review the notes from the Bibliology and How To Study the Bible course included at the end of Session 2, Part 2.
- As you read and study the Bible look for the presence of Christ on every page. He is the Word of God who speaks, the presence of God with Israel.
- He is pictured in the Levitical sacrifices and in every part of the Tabernacle.
- He is foreshadowed, positively or antithetically, in each judge and king and prophet.
- He is the promised offspring of Eve and the Lamb that *“God himself will provide.”* **Genesis 22:8**
- He is the Sabbath rest for our souls, prefigured and present in every line.

Preview of the Next Session

- Begin looking at the first 5 books of the Bible, the Pentateuch.
- Consider Moses’ unique qualifications preparing him to author the Pentateuch.
- Here begins the unfolding of the great record of God’s revelation of himself as Creator and Redeemer and King.

## Key Verses

**(Genesis 1:14, 22:8; Exodus 25:40; John 5:39; 1 Corinthians 10:6; Colossians 2:3; Romans 5:14; Psalm 91:1; Hebrews 10:1)**

## Class Exercise

Be prepared to discuss the KNOW, ARE ABLE TO and WILL BE THINKING ABOUT statements at the beginning of this session in your guidebook.

Review the typology notes from Bibliology and How To Study the Bible. (You may want to watch the Bibliology videos that correspond to these notes, which can be found on the CDI website. Scroll to Session 10, Part 1-2 to find the information on typology.)

## Notes from Bibliology Course

**Fundamental Principle of Hermeneutics**  
Bible is its own best interpreter/commentator

**Definition of Typology**  
A type is an Old Testament person, place, thing, or occurrence that prefigures a person, place, thing, or occurrence found in the New Testament called the antitype. The acronym is PPTO. The prefix anti in this case means *“instead of: rather than “against.”*

- A type is inferior to its antitype in that it is only a shadow of the real thing.
- Not all elements of the type have a direct bearing on the antitype
- A type differs from a symbol in that it foretells of something to come.

**Scriptural Foundation for Typology**  
1 Corinthians 10:6-11

- *“Examples”* – tupos (too-pas) a die struck to leave an imprint.
- Paul begins and ends this passage with the tupos translated *“examples.”*
- In between, he gives a four examples from the OT of God’s people suffering judgment because of sin.

**Hebrews 8:5** *(Hebrews is the New Testament book of Typology)*

- *“Example / Copy”* – hupodeigma (hoop-od'-igue-mah) an exhibit for imitation or warning.
- *“Shadow”* – skia (skee'-ah) a shadow.
- *“Pattern”* – tupos as above.
- A type is an example, a copy, a shadow, a pattern.
- It is not the important thing; it points to the important thing: the anti-type Hebrews 9:9
- *“Figure / Illustration"* – parabole (para-bo-lay) a simulation.

**Hebrews 10:1**

- *“Shadow”* – skia (skee-ah) as above.

**Colossians 2:17**

- *“Shadow”* – skia as above.

**Luke 24:27, 44; John 5:39:** *the Bible is Christocentric.*

- What did Jesus think of typology?
- Did Jesus teach using typology?

**Luke 24:27**

- *“And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.”*

**Luke 24:44**

- *“He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”*

**John 5:39**

- *“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.”*

**The Bible is Christocentric**

- The correct way to use the OT is to demonstrate Jesus. He is the one casting the shadow!

**Two Varieties of Types**  

- **Strong Type**: *comparison of one or more similar features*
- **Antithetical Type**: *contrast between one or more differing features*

**Interpreting Types**

- Start with the clear statements of the New Testament concerning a type
- Stay with sound Scriptural doctrine – types are only for illustration
- Take a type no further than the real point of likeness or contrast
- If a type is not clearly defined as such in the New Testament exercise extreme caution
- Refuse fanciful and farfetched interpretations of types
- Refuse unwarranted typological illustrations
- Look for Jesus – the Bible is Christocentric!

During this course students will encounter various O.T. types. As an exercise in thinking about types
students should select one that is of particular personal interest. Next, students should prepare a
lesson or sermon outline with the following information:

The Type you select. For example: Joseph as a Type of Christ.

- **An introduction or illustration as to the why this type was chosen and its’importance.** For example: *“From the earliest history of God’s chosen people, one man stands out as the Savior of his people. He is an unappreciated prophet, falsely accused and mistreated and yet rises to become God’s means of rescuing the children of Abraham from certain death.”*
- **A Thesis statement** - This is one sentence stating the importance of the Type and what it teaches. For example: *“Joseph: One of many brothers, exalted through suffering set apart for the salvation of his people.”*
- **Outline** – Several main points of the lesson or sermon that the student would want to make. For example:
    - I. Joseph: Unappreciated Dreamer and Prophet
    - II. Joseph: Falsely Accused yet faithful
    - III. Joseph: Exalted to Save His people
- **Conclusion** – A final restatement of the Thesis and the importance of this Biblical Type. For example: Hidden in plain sight, in the first book of the Bible, is one of the greatest revelations of the future suffering and ultimate success of the Promised One who would *“Save his people from their sins.”*
