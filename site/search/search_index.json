In them He has placed a tent for the sun, Acts 14:17 yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.\u201d Psalm 104:5-9 \u00b6He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever. You covered it with the deep sea as with a garment; The waters were standing above the mountains. They fled from Your rebuke, At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away. The mountains rose; the valleys sank down To the place which You established for them. You set a boundary so that they will not pass over, So that they will not return to cover the earth. 2 Peter 3:4-5 and saying, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue just as they were from the beginning of creation.\u201d For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water, Romans 1:19-20 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse. History's witness I Kings 8:56 Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to His people Israel in accordance with everything that He promised; not one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant. Acts 7:2-53 And Stephen said, \u201cListen to me, brothers and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and He said to him, \u2018Go from your country and your relatives, and come to the land which I will show you.\u2019 (GEN 12:1) Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living. But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, He promised that He would give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child. (GEN 12:7; 13:15)* But God spoke to this effect, that his descendants would be strangers in a land that was not theirs, and they would enslave and mistreat them for four hundred years. (GEN 15:13f) \u2018And whatever nation to which they are enslaved I Myself will judge,\u2019 said God, \u2018and after that they will come out and serve Me in this place.\u2019 (EXO 3:12) And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham fathered Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs. \u201cThe patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him, and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and his entire household. \u201cNow a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction with it, and our fathers could find no food. But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time. And on the second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph\u2019s family was revealed to Pharaoh. Then Joseph sent word and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five people in all. And Jacob went down to Egypt, and he and our fathers died there. And they were brought back from there to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. \u201cBut as the time of the promise which God had assured to Abraham was approaching, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt, until another king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. It was he who shrewdly took advantage of our nation and mistreated our fathers in order that they would abandon their infants in the Nile, so that they would not survive. At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful to God. He was nurtured for three months in his father\u2019s home. And after he had been put outside, Pharaoh\u2019s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son. Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was proficient in speaking and action. But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his countrymen, the sons of Israel. And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended and took vengeance for the oppressed man by fatally striking the Egyptian. And he thought that his brothers understood that God was granting them deliverance through him; but they did not understand. And on the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting each other, and he tried to reconcile them to peace, by saying, \u2018Men, you are brothers, why are you injuring each other?\u2019 But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, \u2018Who made you a ruler and judge over us? (EXO 2:14) You do not intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?\u2019 (EXO 2:14) At this remark, Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons. (EXO 2:15,22) \u201cAfter forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning thorn bush. (EXO 3:1f, ISA 63:9) When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, the voice of the Lord came: \u2018I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.\u2019 Moses shook with fear and did not dare to look closely. (EXO 3:6) But the Lord said to him, \u2018Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. (JOSH 5:15) I have certainly seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them; and now come, I will send you to Egypt.\u2019 (EXO 3:7f,10) \u201cThis Moses whom they disowned, saying, \u2018Who made you a ruler and a judge?\u2019 is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush. This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, \u2018God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your countrymen.\u2019 (DEUT 18:15,18) This is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness together with the angel who spoke to him at length on Mount Sinai, and who was with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to you. Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him; on the contrary they rejected him and turned back to Egypt in their hearts, saying to Aaron, \u2018Make us a god who will go before us; for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt\u2014we do not know what happened to him.\u2019 (EXO 32:1,23) At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. But God turned away and gave them over to serve the heavenly lights; as it is written in the book of the prophets: \u2018You did not offer Me victims and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, did you, house of Israel? (AMOS 5:25) You also took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Rompha, the images which you made to worship. I also will deport you beyond Babylon.\u2019 (AMOS 5:26-27) \u201cOur fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen. Our fathers in turn received it, and they also brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations that God drove out from our fathers, until the time of David. David found favor in God\u2019s sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob. But it was Solomon who built a house for Him. However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says: \u2018Heaven is My throne, And the earth is the footstool of My feet; What kind of house will you build for Me?\u2019 says the Lord, \u2018Or what place is there for My rest? (ISA 66:1) \u2018Was it not My hand that made all these things?\u2019 (ISA 66:2) \u201cYou men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did. Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, and you have now become betrayers and murderers of Him; you who received the Law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it.\u201d Acts 17:26-28 and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, that they would seek God, if perhaps they might feel around for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; Conscience's witness Ecclesiastes 3:11 He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, without the possibility that mankind will find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end. 2 Corinthians 3:3 revealing yourselves, that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.

And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, John 1:14,18 14. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 18. No one has seen God at any time; God the only Son, who is in the arms of the Father, He has explained Him. Revelation 19:13 He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. The Spoken Word 1682 references to the spoken revelation of God The Written Word 613 references to the written Revelation of God. \u201cChristocentric\u201d - John 5:39 All Scripture is about Jesus. From Genesis to Revelation the Bible tells one story and it is His story The Bible The Bible was written by a diversity of 40 different authors over a period of 1,500 years, in a variety of locations. However, the Bible is uniquely one book, with one voice, consisting of 66 different books. Its authors came from all walks of life. Some were kings, shepherds, warriors, fishermen, even a Gentile doctor and a tax collector. The Bible is: The Revelation of God 1 Sam 3:21 And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh, because the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord. 2 Tim 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Rom 16:25-26 25. Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, 26. but now has been disclosed, and through the Scriptures of the prophets, in accordance with the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith; Supernaturally Given & Preserved 2 Pe 1:20-21 20. But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture becomes a matter of someone\u2019s own interpretation, 21. for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. Lk 21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. 1 Pe 1:25 But the word of the Lord endures forever.\u201d And this is the word which was preached to you. Alive and Life Giving Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 1 Pe 1:23 for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. A Balm and a Weapon Prov 4:20-22 *\u00b6My son, pay attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. 21They are not to escape from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart. 22For they are life to those who find them, And healing to all their body. Matt 4:4, 7, 10, 4. But He answered and said, \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\u2019\u2009\u201d 7. Jesus said to him, \u201cOn the other hand, it is written: \u2018You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.\u2019\u2009\u201d 10. Then Jesus said to him, \u201cGo away, Satan! For it is written: \u2018You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.\u2019\u2009\u201d Eph 6:10-17 10. Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. 11. Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. 12. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. 13. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 14. Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15. and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16. in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17. And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Object and Source of Faith 1 Thess 2:13 13. For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of mere men, but as what it really is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe. Rom 10:17 17. So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. Complete Rev 22:18-19 18. I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 19. and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book. Comprehensive 2 Tim 3:16-17 16. All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17. so that the man or woman of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work. Infallible Matt 5:18 18. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished! 1 Kings 8:56 56. \u201cBlessed be the Lord, who has given rest to His people Israel in accordance with everything that He promised; not one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant. Inerrant 2 Pe 1:16-19 16. For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. 17For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such a declaration as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory: \u201cThis is My beloved Son with whom I am well pleased\u201d\u2014 18and we ourselves heard this declaration made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. True Jn 8:44 44. You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.

Plenary Inspiration refers to the belief that all parts of Scripture are equally and fully inspired by God. This doctrine holds that the Bible, in its entirety, is divinely inspired, meaning that every section\u2014whether historical, poetic, doctrinal, or moral\u2014is authoritative and without error in its original form. Key Points: \"Plenary\" means \"full\" or \"complete,\" emphasizing that inspiration applies to all parts of the Bible , not just some sections. This doctrine asserts that every word of Scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16) and thus carries divine authority. Plenary inspiration maintains that both the content and form of Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, were guided by the Holy Spirit, making it fully trustworthy in matters of faith, practice, and history. Implications: No Section Is Lesser : All portions of Scripture, from genealogies to prophecy, have equal divine authority. Consistency in Teaching : The Bible is seen as a unified whole, without contradictions, because every part is inspired by God. In summary, plenary inspiration ensures that every part of Scripture is treated with the same reverence and authority as God's Word. What are the implications of Plenary Inspiration? The doctrine of Plenary Inspiration carries several important implications for how Christians understand the Bible and its role in their lives. Here are the key implications: 1. Authority of Scripture Plenary inspiration means that every part of the Bible is fully authoritative because it is equally inspired by God. This means believers should treat all sections of Scripture\u2014whether historical, prophetic, poetic, or doctrinal\u2014as having divine authority. Implication : Christians rely on the entire Bible for guidance in matters of faith and practice, considering it infallible in all it teaches. 2. Inerrancy of Scripture Plenary inspiration leads to the belief in the inerrancy of Scripture \u2014the idea that, because every part of the Bible is inspired by God, it is free from error in its original manuscripts. Since God is truthful and incapable of error, the Bible is viewed as completely trustworthy. Implication : Christians believe the Bible contains no factual or theological mistakes. This affects their approach to interpreting and defending the accuracy of Scripture, especially regarding theological doctrines and historical events. 3. Unity and Coherence of Scripture The Bible is viewed as a unified whole , despite being written by various authors over centuries. Plenary inspiration asserts that the Holy Spirit inspired every part, so all Scripture is consistent and complementary, without contradictions. Implication : The Bible is interpreted in a holistic way, where one part of Scripture can shed light on or clarify another part. This gives rise to the practice of systematic theology , where Christians study the Bible\u2019s teachings on various topics, trusting that it presents a coherent worldview. 4. Applicability of All Scripture Since all parts of Scripture are equally inspired, every passage has applicability for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Even seemingly obscure or historical sections are seen as having relevance for the believer\u2019s spiritual life. Implication : Christians are encouraged to study the whole Bible, not just favorite or more familiar portions, believing that all parts of it are beneficial for instruction and spiritual growth. 5. Interpretation of Scripture Because of plenary inspiration, careful interpretation of Scripture is necessary. Christians believe they must interpret the Bible accurately and in context, recognizing that the Holy Spirit inspired both the human authors and the exact words they used. Implication : Churches often emphasize expository preaching and encourage believers to engage in hermeneutics (the science of interpreting Scripture) to rightly divide the Word of Truth. Literal interpretation is often favored, while figurative or symbolic meanings are handled with care. 6. Doctrinal Consistency Plenary inspiration asserts that all doctrinal teaching in Scripture is inspired, which means that there is no hierarchy of truth within the Bible. Every doctrine, whether related to salvation, ethics, or God\u2019s nature, comes from God\u2019s inspired Word and must be treated with equal seriousness. Implication : Christian doctrines are drawn from the whole of Scripture, and doctrinal formulations (like creeds or confessions) are often based on the consistent teaching of all Scripture, not just isolated passages. 7. The Bible as Sufficient Revelation Plenary inspiration supports the belief that the Bible is a sufficient source of revelation for all that Christians need to know about faith, morality, and salvation. It is not just one source among many, but the complete and final revelation of God\u2019s will. Implication : Christians do not need to seek additional revelation beyond the Bible for matters of faith or conduct, as the Bible is viewed as complete and sufficient for guiding life and worship. 8. Moral and Ethical Guidance The Bible, being fully inspired, is the standard for moral and ethical decision-making . All commandments and principles in the Bible are viewed as authoritative for how Christians should live. Implication : Believers seek to align their moral choices and lifestyle with biblical teachings, trusting that all parts of the Bible provide wisdom for ethical living, including how to treat others, handle money, and pursue justice. In summary, Plenary Inspiration affirms that all Scripture is fully inspired, authoritative, and free from error. This has far-reaching implications for how Christians interpret, apply, and trust the Bible in all aspects of life, doctrine, and church practice. The Bible is the final authority not only on faith and practice, but final authority on any subject the bible addresses itself on. ie.. History, social, geography, When the 40 writers wrote the original 66 books of the Bible there was no errors, no mistakes, not one jot was misplaced There was no omissions, everything God wanted to include and in its timing was included Preserved from authors making addtions to the word written The authors wrote with the words in the order God intended God super-intended and the authors were instruments to the complete scriptures Methods of Special Inspiration Methods of Special Inspiration refer to the ways in which God uniquely guided the writers of Scripture to produce the Bible as His inspired Word. Different approaches to understanding how this divine inspiration occurred have been proposed. Here are some of the key methods: 1. Dictation Method Description : In this method, it is believed that God directly dictated the words of Scripture to the human authors, who acted as passive instruments, writing exactly what God communicated without adding their personal style or interpretation. Example : The Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 or some prophetic utterances (e.g., \"Thus says the Lord...\") are often viewed as being given by direct dictation from God. Implication : This method emphasizes that the exact words of Scripture are God's own words, making them completely authoritative. 2. Verbal Plenary Inspiration Description : This method teaches that God inspired not only the ideas or concepts but also the very words (verbal) of Scripture, while still using the individual styles, personalities, and cultural contexts of the human authors. \"Plenary\" means full, indicating that all parts of Scripture are equally inspired. Implication : This balances divine control and human authorship, where every word in the original manuscripts is seen as inspired by God, while also reflecting the uniqueness of the human author. 3. Illumination Method Description : The illumination view suggests that the Holy Spirit worked in a heightened way to illuminate the minds of the human authors, guiding them to write Scripture. This method places more emphasis on the enlightenment of the author rather than dictation or exact words. Implication : While this method suggests divine influence, it leaves room for the author\u2019s personal thoughts, emotions, and expressions, guided by the Holy Spirit. 4. Dynamic Inspiration Description : This method asserts that God inspired the thoughts or ideas of the biblical writers, allowing them to choose the words and expressions that conveyed those ideas. Here, God provided the conceptual content , but the human authors retained the freedom to express these ideas in their own style. Implication : It emphasizes the involvement of both divine and human agency. Scripture is still authoritative, but the focus is on the inspiration of the message rather than each individual word. 5. Superintendence Method Description : This approach holds that God superintended or oversaw the entire writing process, guiding the biblical writers to write what He intended while maintaining their human characteristics, perspectives, and literary styles. Implication : This emphasizes that while human authors were fully involved, God sovereignly ensured that what was written was exactly what He wanted, making Scripture infallible and authoritative. 6. Ecstatic Inspiration Description : In this less common view, some believe that biblical writers may have been inspired in an ecstatic or trance-like state . This is thought to have occurred when the Holy Spirit moved the authors to write under divine influence without conscious control over the content. Implication : It suggests a more mystical process of inspiration, where human authors were not fully aware of their role, acting more as instruments of divine revelation. Summary: Each of these methods highlights different aspects of how the Bible might have been inspired. While some emphasize God's direct control over every word (e.g., Dictation, Verbal Plenary Inspiration ), others allow for more human involvement in the expression of God's message (e.g., Dynamic Inspiration, Illumination ). All methods agree on the core belief that Scripture is divinely inspired , but they differ on the level of direct involvement by God in the writing process. What are the implications of Methods of Inspiration? The Methods of Inspiration have several implications for how Christians understand the nature of the Bible, its authority, and the role of the human authors. Here are the key implications: 1. Divine Authority and Infallibility Implication : Depending on the method of inspiration, the Bible is considered either fully inerrant (without error) in its original texts or inspired primarily in its message. For methods like Verbal Plenary Inspiration or Dictation , every word is seen as directly from God, making the Bible's authority absolute. This leads to a belief in the infallibility of Scripture, meaning it cannot mislead or deceive. Impact : Christians treat the Bible as the ultimate authority for faith, moral guidance, and doctrine. The Bible's teachings are viewed as binding and trustworthy in every aspect. 2. Role of Human Authors Implication : Methods like Dynamic Inspiration or Superintendence suggest a more cooperative role between God and the human authors, where the authors' personalities, cultural backgrounds, and writing styles are used, but the divine message remains intact. Impact : This view allows for diversity in the literary genres, tone, and perspectives within the Bible, but it still holds that God guided the content. Understanding this allows for more nuanced interpretation, acknowledging the historical and cultural contexts in which the Bible was written. 3. Inerrancy Debate Implication : The method of inspiration affects how one understands biblical inerrancy . For example, Dictation Theory supports a view of inerrancy where even the smallest details, such as dates or minor facts, must be accurate. In contrast, Dynamic Inspiration focuses on the Bible being inerrant in matters of faith and practice, allowing for possible discrepancies in minor historical or scientific details. Impact : This influences theological debates about how strictly the Bible should be interpreted in light of modern knowledge, especially concerning history and science. It also shapes Christian approaches to apologetics. 4. Hermeneutics and Interpretation Implication : Different methods of inspiration lead to different approaches in hermeneutics , the science of interpreting Scripture. For example, Verbal Plenary Inspiration suggests that every word is carefully chosen by God, making careful study of the original language (Hebrew and Greek) critical. In contrast, a more Dynamic view might focus on the overarching message rather than individual words. Impact : This shapes how Christians approach Bible study and preaching. Those who hold to Verbal Plenary Inspiration may focus on literal interpretation, while others may emphasize the spirit or meaning of the text over its literal wording. 5. Theological Consistency Implication : Methods like Superintendence or Verbal Plenary Inspiration support the belief that all Scripture is consistent and without contradiction because God ensured the integrity of the whole Bible. This results in the belief that the Bible presents a coherent and unified theological message . Impact : Christians expect that doctrine drawn from different parts of the Bible will align harmoniously, reinforcing core theological beliefs like the nature of God, salvation, and morality. 6. The Sufficiency of Scripture Implication : All methods of inspiration affirm that Scripture is sufficient for teaching, correction, and equipping believers for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17). However, methods like Illumination or Dynamic Inspiration might imply that human authors played a more active role, possibly leaving room for new interpretations or understandings over time. Impact : This influences whether Christians view the Bible as needing additional revelation (like tradition or reason) for understanding God's will or whether it is fully sufficient on its own. 7. Pastoral and Ethical Application Implication : The view of inspiration affects how Christians apply the Bible to ethical and moral decisions . For those holding a Verbal Inspiration view, every command or law in the Bible is binding, while those favoring Dynamic Inspiration may focus on the broader principles or moral truths conveyed by Scripture, potentially allowing more flexibility in application. Impact : This impacts how churches handle issues like church governance, ethical questions, or social issues , often guiding whether a literal or more principle-based approach is taken. Summary The method of inspiration adopted by a Christian impacts their view of Scripture\u2019s authority, how they interpret and apply the Bible, their understanding of inerrancy, and how they navigate ethical decisions and doctrine. What does it mean for Bible Study? In the context of Bible study , the method of inspiration chosen has significant implications for how Christians interpret, analyze, and apply the Scriptures: 1. Emphasis on Word-for-Word Study (Verbal Inspiration) Implication : If you adopt the Verbal Plenary Inspiration view, you will likely focus on word-for-word analysis , recognizing each term in the original Hebrew or Greek as intentionally chosen by God. This promotes the practice of studying original languages, looking at specific words in detail, and ensuring a literal interpretation where possible. Example : In Bible study, this could mean focusing on how individual words or phrases are used and exploring the significance of verb tenses, grammatical structure, and vocabulary to uncover deeper meanings. 2. Contextual and Thematic Study (Dynamic Inspiration) Implication : If you lean toward Dynamic Inspiration , the focus might be more on the broader themes and ideas presented in Scripture, rather than dissecting every word. You may prioritize the message or the intention of the passage, acknowledging that human authors expressed God's thoughts in their unique language and context. Example : Bible study in this case might emphasize understanding the cultural, historical, and personal background of the authors and how God\u2019s overarching message was conveyed through them. 3. Scripture Interpreting Scripture (Plenary Inspiration) Implication : With Plenary Inspiration , which asserts that all Scripture is equally inspired, there is an emphasis on the Bible's unity. You would practice interpreting Scripture with Scripture , recognizing that different parts of the Bible inform and clarify each other. Example : A Bible study might compare various passages across different books to understand a theme, doctrine, or moral principle, such as studying Paul\u2019s epistles alongside the Gospels to get a fuller picture of salvation or sanctification. 4. Literal vs. Symbolic Interpretation Implication : The method of inspiration influences whether a passage is interpreted literally or symbolically. For instance, those who emphasize Verbal Inspiration may lean toward a literal interpretation , particularly in areas of prophecy or law. In contrast, with Dynamic Inspiration , there might be more openness to symbolic or metaphorical interpretations. Example : In Bible study, this could affect how you read prophetic texts (such as Revelation) or poetic literature (like Psalms), determining whether certain descriptions are understood as literal future events or symbolic of spiritual truths. 5. Practical Application Implication : Different views on inspiration also affect how you apply the Bible to daily life. A focus on Plenary Inspiration could lead you to see all parts of the Bible as directly applicable, from Old Testament laws to New Testament teachings, while those favoring Dynamic Inspiration might apply principles more flexibly based on broader themes of God\u2019s will. Example : In Bible study, you might move from understanding what the text says to discerning how it applies to personal ethics, social justice, or spiritual growth in today's world. 6. Role of the Holy Spirit Implication : The role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination is emphasized in all forms of inspiration but particularly in Illumination Method , where the Spirit helps believers understand and apply Scripture. The Holy Spirit is viewed as guiding not just the authors but also the readers in properly interpreting the Bible. Example : During Bible study, this could manifest in prayerful reflection and seeking the Spirit\u2019s guidance to grasp the deeper meaning of the text and apply it to one\u2019s life. In summary, the method of inspiration informs how deeply Christians engage with the Bible at the word level, how they approach themes and ideas, how literally or symbolically they interpret passages, and how they apply the Bible\u2019s teachings to everyday life. What does it mean for Christian doctrine? Methods of Special Inspiration refer to the ways in which God communicated His Word to the biblical authors, ensuring the Bible's divine origin and truth. When discussing Christian Doctrine, these methods have significant implications for how doctrines are formed, understood, and practiced. Authority of Scripture in Doctrine Implication: Special inspiration asserts that the Bible is God\u2019s direct revelation, communicated through various methods like visions, dictation, and the inner guidance of the Holy Spirit. This reinforces the idea that Christian doctrines, whether about God, salvation, or morality, are not merely human ideas but divinely revealed truths. Therefore, Christian doctrine must rely entirely on Scripture as the authoritative source. Impact on Doctrine: This ensures that doctrines like the Trinity, the nature of Christ, the fall of humanity, and salvation are based on an inspired and infallible source, giving these teachings absolute authority. Infallibility and Inerrancy Implication: Methods of special inspiration support the belief that the Bible is inerrant (without error) and infallible (incapable of leading astray). Since God directly inspired Scripture, Christian doctrine derived from the Bible is trustworthy and without error in what it affirms. Impact on Doctrine: Doctrines such as the deity of Christ, resurrection, and atonement must be accepted without compromise, as they are based on the inspired, error-free Word of God. This foundation strengthens doctrinal certainty and prevents deviations or false teachings. Clarity and Sufficiency of Doctrine Implication: Special inspiration implies that God communicated His message clearly and intentionally through Scripture, ensuring its sufficiency for guiding Christian faith and practice. Everything necessary for salvation, spiritual growth, and understanding God\u2019s will is contained in Scripture. Impact on Doctrine: This belief influences doctrines like sola scriptura (Scripture alone), which asserts that the Bible alone is sufficient for defining doctrine. It means that no additional revelation or external authority is needed to establish essential Christian beliefs. Doctrinal Consistency Implication: Because special inspiration assumes that God inspired the entire Bible, Christian doctrine is drawn from the unified teachings of all Scripture. There is doctrinal consistency across the Bible\u2019s different books, despite their diverse authors and contexts, because the same Holy Spirit inspired them. Impact on Doctrine: Doctrines like salvation by grace through faith, God\u2019s sovereignty, and eschatology (end times) are seen as consistent themes throughout Scripture, forming a cohesive system of beliefs. This prevents contradictory or isolated interpretations and ensures that doctrines are developed from a holistic view of Scripture. Doctrinal Defense and Apologetics Implication: The doctrine of special inspiration equips Christians to defend their faith because it affirms that Scripture is divinely inspired, authoritative, and reliable. When forming doctrine or engaging in apologetics, Christians rely on the inspired nature of Scripture as their ultimate defense for their beliefs. Impact on Doctrine: This empowers Christians to stand firm on doctrines such as the resurrection of Christ, the inerrancy of Scripture, and the nature of sin, using the inspired Word as the final authority against challenges or false teachings. Conclusion The methods of special inspiration impact Christian doctrine by establishing the Bible\u2019s authority, inerrancy, clarity, and sufficiency. This ensures that all Christian beliefs are rooted in divine revelation, making them trustworthy and consistent across the entire biblical text. For Christian doctrine, this means that Scripture remains the ultimate guide for teaching, correction, and living out the faith. What does it mean for Church Practice? In the context of Methods of Special Inspiration , the way God uniquely inspired the Bible\u2019s authors directly impacts church practice by shaping how the church functions in its teaching, worship, and ministry. Here's how it affects key aspects of church practice: 1. Preaching and Teaching Implication : If Scripture is divinely inspired through various methods (such as direct dictation, prophetic revelation, or the guidance of the Holy Spirit), then church leaders must prioritize faithful exposition of Scripture in preaching and teaching. Every word of the Bible is seen as authoritative, so the church is responsible for explaining and applying Scripture accurately. Impact on Practice : Sermons and Bible studies focus on careful interpretation of the inspired Word, often emphasizing expository preaching (verse-by-verse explanation). This ensures that the teaching of doctrine is grounded in what the Bible actually says, respecting the method of its divine origin. 2. Worship Structure Implication : Since the Bible is seen as a product of special inspiration, worship practices must align with what Scripture prescribes. Churches base their liturgy, prayers, songs , and sacraments on biblical guidelines, seeing the inspired Word as a model for how to approach God. Impact on Practice : For example, churches that observe the Lord\u2019s Supper or baptism do so with specific references to Scripture, following the biblical instructions given by Jesus or the apostles (e.g., 1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Worship songs and prayers are often biblically inspired, reflecting Scripture's language and theology. 3. Scripture as the Final Authority Implication : Since special inspiration declares the Bible to be God's ultimate revelation, the church submits to Scripture as the final authority in all matters of faith and practice. Church decisions, doctrinal statements, and disciplinary actions must be informed by and consistent with Scripture. Impact on Practice : In matters of church governance , conflict resolution, or doctrinal debates, church leaders turn to Scripture as the final source of guidance. This may include consulting biblical models for leadership (e.g., qualifications for elders in 1 Timothy 3) or resolving moral or ethical issues according to Scripture. 4. Discipleship and Spiritual Formation Implication : The methods of special inspiration imply that the Bible is not only an ancient text but also a living Word meant for the edification and transformation of believers. Thus, the church\u2019s discipleship programs are built on the foundation of helping members engage deeply with Scripture. Impact on Practice : Bible studies, discipleship groups, and Sunday school programs focus on teaching the Bible in a way that allows believers to grow in their faith and character, trusting that the inspired Word is essential for spiritual growth. The church encourages memorization, meditation, and application of Scripture (as in Psalm 119:11). 5. Church Discipline Implication : The belief in special inspiration gives the church the responsibility to exercise church discipline based on the inspired commands and principles found in the Bible. Scripture provides clear guidelines on how to deal with sin within the church body. Impact on Practice : Churches follow biblical procedures for addressing unrepentant sin, such as the steps outlined in Matthew 18:15-17, ensuring that discipline is carried out in a manner that reflects the inspired Word's wisdom and justice. The goal is always restoration, guided by the authority of Scripture. 6. Mission and Evangelism Implication : Since special inspiration reveals that the Bible contains the message of salvation and the mission of the church, evangelism and mission efforts are rooted in the Gospel message found in Scripture. The church's mission is to share the inspired Word with the world. Impact on Practice : Churches are committed to fulfilling the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20), preaching the Gospel as revealed in Scripture. Outreach programs, evangelism training, and missions are grounded in the belief that the inspired Word is the primary tool for bringing people to faith. 7. Sacraments and Ordinances Implication : The methods of special inspiration ensure that sacraments (or ordinances) such as baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are observed according to biblical instructions. The inspired nature of Scripture makes these practices central to church life. Impact on Practice : Churches perform these rites in a way that directly reflects the biblical models. Baptism is done in obedience to Christ\u2019s command (Matthew 28:19), and communion is observed following Paul\u2019s recounting of Jesus\u2019 instructions (1 Corinthians 11:23-26), with reverence for their inspired origin. Conclusion For church practice, the methods of special inspiration reinforce the Bible\u2019s authority, directing every aspect of church life\u2014from teaching and worship to discipline and evangelism. It ensures that the church's ministry remains faithful to the inspired, inerrant Word of God, shaping how the church operates and fulfills its mission in the world. What does it mean for Christian Living? In the context of Methods of Special Inspiration , which refers to how God uniquely communicated His Word to the biblical authors, the impact on Christian living is profound. Special inspiration means that every part of Scripture is divinely authored, guiding Christians in all aspects of life and moral conduct. Here's what it means for Christian living: 1. Scripture as the Foundation for Living Implication : The Bible, being divinely inspired, serves as the ultimate authority for how Christians should live. Every word is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16), meaning that believers can fully trust it to guide their thoughts, actions, and decisions in daily life. Impact on Life : Christians are encouraged to look to Scripture for direction in all areas\u2014how to love others (John 13:34), avoid sin (Psalm 119:11), and honor God in relationships, work, and personal habits. It provides principles for righteous living and instructions for moral behavior. 2. Moral and Ethical Guidance Implication : Since the Bible is inspired by God, it provides an absolute moral compass for Christians. Special inspiration affirms that God's commands, as revealed in Scripture, are not merely cultural or temporal but universal truths that transcend time. Impact on Life : Christians are called to live according to God\u2019s standards, such as the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) and the teachings of Jesus (Matthew 5-7). Ethical decisions, such as honesty, integrity, sexual purity, and generosity, are all shaped by biblical teachings. 3. Dependence on the Holy Spirit Implication : The Bible was inspired by the Holy Spirit, and this same Spirit now dwells within believers (John 14:26). Christian living involves dependence on the Holy Spirit for understanding Scripture and applying it in daily life. Impact on Life : Christians are called to yield to the guidance of the Holy Spirit in decisions and actions. The Spirit helps believers live out biblical principles, grow in spiritual maturity, and reflect the character of Christ (Galatians 5:22-23). It\u2019s not just knowing Scripture, but allowing the Spirit to transform the heart and mind. 4. Transformation of Character Implication : Special inspiration emphasizes that the Bible is God\u2019s tool for transforming lives. Through regular engagement with Scripture, believers are sanctified and conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 12:2). Impact on Life : Christian living is marked by ongoing transformation\u2014believers become more Christlike in their thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. By applying biblical teachings, they grow in love, patience, humility, and other virtues listed as the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). 5. Trusting in God's Promises Implication : The inspired Word is filled with God\u2019s promises, and because it is directly from God, Christians can trust in these promises with confidence. The assurance of salvation, eternal life, and God's faithfulness comes from the reliability of Scripture. Impact on Life : Christians live in faith, trusting in promises like God\u2019s provision (Philippians 4:19), His presence (Hebrews 13:5), and His future hope (John 14:1-3). This trust allows them to navigate challenges with peace and confidence, knowing that God\u2019s Word is true. 6. Living in Obedience to God's Commands Implication : Since the Bible is inspired by God, it contains commands that Christians are expected to follow in every aspect of life\u2014whether in relationships, work, or personal conduct. Special inspiration means that all Scripture is relevant for godly living. Impact on Life : Obedience to the Bible\u2019s instructions becomes a priority for the Christian. Believers are called to live out commands like loving one another (John 13:34), forgiving others (Ephesians 4:32), and practicing humility (Philippians 2:3-4). They do so, knowing that they are following God\u2019s direct revelation. 7. Preparation for Eternal Life Implication : The Bible, as God\u2019s inspired revelation, points believers to the reality of eternal life. Special inspiration reminds Christians that this life is temporary and that their focus should be on eternal things. Impact on Life : Christians are encouraged to live with an eternal perspective, prioritizing their relationship with God and their eternal inheritance (1 Peter 1:4). This perspective shapes how they handle earthly matters like possessions, relationships, and personal ambitions, with an eye toward eternity (Colossians 3:1-2). Conclusion For Christian living, the methods of special inspiration mean that the Bible is the authoritative guide for how to live a life that pleases God. Every aspect of a Christian\u2019s life, from moral decisions to spiritual growth, is informed by the divinely inspired Word. This shapes how believers interact with others, grow in their faith, and live out their calling in the world, knowing they are following God's revealed will.","title":"Plenary Inspiration"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#plenary-inspiration","text":"The whole of scripture is inspired both in substance and in structure","title":"Plenary Inspiration"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#what-is-the-definition-of-plenary-inspiration","text":"Plenary Inspiration refers to the belief that all parts of Scripture are equally and fully inspired by God.

Scripture Interpreting Scripture (Plenary Inspiration)"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#4-literal-vs-symbolic-interpretation","text":"Implication : The method of inspiration influences whether a passage is interpreted literally or symbolically. For instance, those who emphasize Verbal Inspiration may lean toward a literal interpretation , particularly in areas of prophecy or law. In contrast, with Dynamic Inspiration , there might be more openness to symbolic or metaphorical interpretations. Example : In Bible study, this could affect how you read prophetic texts (such as Revelation) or poetic literature (like Psalms), determining whether certain descriptions are understood as literal future events or symbolic of spiritual truths.","title":"4. Literal vs. Symbolic Interpretation"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#5-practical-application","text":"Implication : Different views on inspiration also affect how you apply the Bible to daily life. A focus on Plenary Inspiration could lead you to see all parts of the Bible as directly applicable, from Old Testament laws to New Testament teachings, while those favoring Dynamic Inspiration might apply principles more flexibly based on broader themes of God\u2019s will. Example : In Bible study, you might move from understanding what the text says to discerning how it applies to personal ethics, social justice, or spiritual growth in today's world.","title":"5. Practical Application"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#6-role-of-the-holy-spirit","text":"Implication : The role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination is emphasized in all forms of inspiration but particularly in Illumination Method , where the Spirit helps believers understand and apply Scripture. The Holy Spirit is viewed as guiding not just the authors but also the readers in properly interpreting the Bible. Example : During Bible study, this could manifest in prayerful reflection and seeking the Spirit\u2019s guidance to grasp the deeper meaning of the text and apply it to one\u2019s life. In summary, the method of inspiration informs how deeply Christians engage with the Bible at the word level, how they approach themes and ideas, how literally or symbolically they interpret passages, and how they apply the Bible\u2019s teachings to everyday life.","title":"6. Role of the Holy Spirit"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#what-does-it-mean-for-christian-doctrine","text":"Methods of Special Inspiration refer to the ways in which God communicated His Word to the biblical authors, ensuring the Bible's divine origin and truth. When discussing Christian Doctrine, these methods have significant implications for how doctrines are formed, understood, and practiced. Authority of Scripture in Doctrine Implication: Special inspiration asserts that the Bible is God\u2019s direct revelation, communicated through various methods like visions, dictation, and the inner guidance of the Holy Spirit. This reinforces the idea that Christian doctrines, whether about God, salvation, or morality, are not merely human ideas but divinely revealed truths. Therefore, Christian doctrine must rely entirely on Scripture as the authoritative source. Impact on Doctrine: This ensures that doctrines like the Trinity, the nature of Christ, the fall of humanity, and salvation are based on an inspired and infallible source, giving these teachings absolute authority. Infallibility and Inerrancy Implication: Methods of special inspiration support the belief that the Bible is inerrant (without error) and infallible (incapable of leading astray). Since God directly inspired Scripture, Christian doctrine derived from the Bible is trustworthy and without error in what it affirms. Impact on Doctrine: Doctrines such as the deity of Christ, resurrection, and atonement must be accepted without compromise, as they are based on the inspired, error-free Word of God. This foundation strengthens doctrinal certainty and prevents deviations or false teachings. Clarity and Sufficiency of Doctrine Implication: Special inspiration implies that God communicated His message clearly and intentionally through Scripture, ensuring its sufficiency for guiding Christian faith and practice. Everything necessary for salvation, spiritual growth, and understanding God\u2019s will is contained in Scripture. Impact on Doctrine: This belief influences doctrines like sola scriptura (Scripture alone), which asserts that the Bible alone is sufficient for defining doctrine. It means that no additional revelation or external authority is needed to establish essential Christian beliefs. Doctrinal Consistency Implication: Because special inspiration assumes that God inspired the entire Bible, Christian doctrine is drawn from the unified teachings of all Scripture. There is doctrinal consistency across the Bible\u2019s different books, despite their diverse authors and contexts, because the same Holy Spirit inspired them. Impact on Doctrine: Doctrines like salvation by grace through faith, God\u2019s sovereignty, and eschatology (end times) are seen as consistent themes throughout Scripture, forming a cohesive system of beliefs. This prevents contradictory or isolated interpretations and ensures that doctrines are developed from a holistic view of Scripture. Doctrinal Defense and Apologetics Implication: The doctrine of special inspiration equips Christians to defend their faith because it affirms that Scripture is divinely inspired, authoritative, and reliable. When forming doctrine or engaging in apologetics, Christians rely on the inspired nature of Scripture as their ultimate defense for their beliefs. Impact on Doctrine: This empowers Christians to stand firm on doctrines such as the resurrection of Christ, the inerrancy of Scripture, and the nature of sin, using the inspired Word as the final authority against challenges or false teachings. Conclusion The methods of special inspiration impact Christian doctrine by establishing the Bible\u2019s authority, inerrancy, clarity, and sufficiency. This ensures that all Christian beliefs are rooted in divine revelation, making them trustworthy and consistent across the entire biblical text. For Christian doctrine, this means that Scripture remains the ultimate guide for teaching, correction, and living out the faith.","title":"What does it mean for Christian doctrine?"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#what-does-it-mean-for-church-practice","text":"In the context of Methods of Special Inspiration , the way God uniquely inspired the Bible\u2019s authors directly impacts church practice by shaping how the church functions in its teaching, worship, and ministry.

Every word of the Bible is seen as authoritative, so the church is responsible for explaining and applying Scripture accurately. Impact on Practice : Sermons and Bible studies focus on careful interpretation of the inspired Word, often emphasizing expository preaching (verse-by-verse explanation). This ensures that the teaching of doctrine is grounded in what the Bible actually says, respecting the method of its divine origin.","title":"1. Preaching and Teaching"},{"location":"Bibliography/Plenary/#2-worship-structure","text":"Implication : Since the Bible is seen as a product of special inspiration, worship practices must align with what Scripture prescribes.

John 6:14 - Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, \u201cThis is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.\u201d \u201cministered as a priest (though not a Levite)\u201d O.T. Psalm 110:4 - The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind, \u201cYou are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201d N.T. Hebrews 5:1-10; 7:1-28 - For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 2he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness; 3and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself. 4And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was. 5So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, \u201cYou are My Son, Today I have begotten You\u201d; 6just as He says also in another passage, \u201cYou are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201d 7In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety. 8Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. 9And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation, 10being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. - For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually. 4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. 11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him, \u201cYou are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201d 18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, \u201cThe Lord has sworn And will not change His mind, \u2018You are a priest forever\u2019\u2009\u201d); 22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. 23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. 26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever. \u201crejected by the Jews\u201d O.T. Isaiah 53:3 - He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. N.T. John 1:11; 5:43; - He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him. - I have come in My Father\u2019s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. N.T. Luke 23:18; - But they cried out all together, saying, \u201cAway with this man, and release for us Barabbas!\u201d 19(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder.) N.T. Acts 3:14-15 - But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 15but put to death the Prince of life, the one whom God raised from the dead, a fact to which we are witnesses. \u201cSpirit of wisdom and understanding\u201d O.T. Isaiah 11:2 - The Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. N.T. Matthew 13:54 - He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, \u201cWhere did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? \u201cdeaf, dumb, blind and lame healed\u201d O.T. Isaiah 35:5-6 - Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. 6Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the Arabah. N.T. Luke 7:22 - And He answered and said to them, \u201cGo and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the gospel preached to them. \u201cgood news preached to the poor and broken hearted\u201d O.T. Isaiah 61:1 - The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, Because the Lord has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; N.T. Luke 7:22 - And He answered and said to them, \u201cGo and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the gospel preached to them. \u201chumble entry on a donkey\u201d O.T. Zechariah 9:9 - Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. N.T. John 12:13-14 - took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, \u201cHosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.\u201d 14Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written \u201cbetrayed by a friend\u201d O.T. Psalm 41:9 - Even my close friend in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me. Mark 14:10 - Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them. \u201csold for 30 pieces of silver\u201d O.T. Zechariah 11:12 - I said to them, \u201cIf it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u201d So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. N.T. Matthew 26:15 - and said, \u201cWhat are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?\u201d And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. \u201cmoney cast down in temple\u201d O.T. Zechariah 11:13 - Then the Lord said to me, \u201cThrow it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u201d So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the Lord. Matthew 27:5 - And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. \u201cmoney given to a potter\u201d O.T. Zechariah 11:13 - Then the Lord said to me, \u201cThrow it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u201d So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the Lord. Matthew 27:7 - And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter\u2019s Field as a burial place for strangers. \u201ccondemned without a fair trial\u201d Isaiah 53:8 - By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due? Matthew 27:1 - Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death; \u201caccused by false witnesses\u201d Psalm 35:11-12 - Malicious witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I do not know. 12They repay me evil for good, To the bereavement of my soul. Matthew 26:59-61 - Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death. 60They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward, 61and said, \u201cThis man stated, \u2018I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.\u2019\u2009\u201d \u201cbeaten and spit upon\u201d Isaiah 50:6 - I gave My back to those who strike Me, And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard; I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting.

And let my cry for help come to You. 2Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my distress; Incline Your ear to me; In the day when I call answer me quickly. 3For my days have been consumed in smoke, And my bones have been scorched like a hearth. 4My heart has been smitten like grass and has withered away, Indeed, I forget to eat my bread. 5Because of the loudness of my groaning My bones cling to my flesh. 6I resemble a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl of the waste places. 7I lie awake, I have become like a lonely bird on a housetop. 8My enemies have reproached me all day long; Those who deride me have used my name as a curse. 9For I have eaten ashes like bread And mingled my drink with weeping 10Because of Your indignation and Your wrath, For You have lifted me up and cast me away. 11My days are like a lengthened shadow, And I wither away like grass. 12But You, O Lord, abide forever, And Your name to all generations. 13You will arise and have compassion on Zion; For it is time to be gracious to her, For the appointed time has come. 14Surely Your servants find pleasure in her stones And feel pity for her dust. 15So the nations will fear the name of the Lord And all the kings of the earth Your glory. 16For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory. 17He has regarded the prayer of the destitute And has not despised their prayer. 18This will be written for the generation to come, That a people yet to be created may praise the Lord. 19For He looked down from His holy height; From heaven the Lord gazed upon the earth, 20To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To set free those who were doomed to death, 21That men may tell of the name of the Lord in Zion And His praise in Jerusalem, 22When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord. 23He has weakened my strength in the way; He has shortened my days. 24I say, \u201cO my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days, Your years are throughout all generations. 25Of old You founded the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. 26Even they will perish, but You endure; And all of them will wear out like a garment; Like clothing You will change them and they will be changed. 27But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an end. 28The children of Your servants will continue, And their descendants will be established before You.\u201d Matthew 27:29-31 - And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d 30They spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head. 31After they had mocked Him, they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him. \u201ctaunted with \u2018No help from God for you!\u2019\u201d Psalm 22:6-8 - But I am a worm and not a man, A reproach of men and despised by the people. 7All who see me sneer at me; They separate with the lip, they wag the head, saying, 8\u201cCommit yourself to the Lord; let Him deliver him; Let Him rescue him, because He delights in him.\u201d Matthew 27:39-43 - And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads 40and saying, \u201cYou who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.\u201d 41In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying, 42\u201cHe saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him. 43He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now, if He delights in Him; for He said, \u2018I am the Son of God.\u2019\u2009\u201d \u201chands and feet pierced\u201d Psalm 22:16 - For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has encompassed me; They pierced my hands and my feet. John 19:23; 20:25 - Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece. - So the other disciples were saying to him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d But he said to them, \u201cUnless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.\u201d \u201cclothing parceled out, but one piece gambled for whole\u201d Psalm 22:18 - They divide my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast lots. John 19:23-24 - Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece. 24So they said to one another, \u201cLet us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be\u201d; this was to fulfill the Scripture: \u201cThey divided My outer garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.\u201d \u201cinsulted while dying with wagging heads and scorn\u201d Psalm 22:7 - All who see me sneer at me; They separate with the lip, they wag the head, saying, Matthew 27:39 - And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads \u201ccrucified with sinners\u201d Isaiah 53:12 - Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the booty with the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death, And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the transgressors. Matthew 27:38 - At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.* \u201cgiven gall and vinegar to drink\u201d Psalm 69:21 - They also gave me gall for my food And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Matthew 27:34; 48 - they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink. - Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink \u201cno bones broken\u201d Psalm 34:20 - He keeps all his bones, Not one of them is broken. John 19:33 - but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. \u201cforsaken of God\u201d Psalm 22:1 - My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning. Matthew 27:46 - About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, \u201cEli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\u201d that is, \u201cMy God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?\u201d \u201cdied at the appointed time foretold to Daniel\u201d Daniel 9:24-26 - \u201cSeventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place. 25So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress. 26Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined. Seven seventies (490 years) is the determined time. The death of Christ happened at the Passover in the month Nisan, in the four thousand seven hundred and forty-sixth year of the Julian period. Four hundred and ninety years, reckoned back from the above year, leads us directly to the month Nisan in the four thousand two hundred and fifty-sixth year of the same period; the very month and year in which Ezra had his commission from Artaxerxes Longimanus, king of Persia, to restore and rebuild Jerusalem. \u201cburied in a rich man\u2019s tomb\u201d Isaiah 53:9 - His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth. Matthew 27:57-60 - When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. 58This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 60and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. \uf0dc \u201craised from the dead\u201d Psalm 16:10 - For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay. Matthew 28:5-9 - The angel said to the women, \u201cDo not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. 6He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying. 7Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you.\u201d 8And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples. 9And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him \u201crise from the dead on the third day\u201d Hosea 6:2 - He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him. Matthew 27:57-28:6 - When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. 58This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 60and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. 61And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave. 62Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate, 63and said, \u201cSir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, \u2018After three days I am to rise again.\u2019 64Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, \u2018He has risen from the dead,\u2019 and the last deception will be worse than the first.\u201d 65Pilate said to them, \u201cYou have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how.\u201d 66And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone. - Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave. 2And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. 3And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 4The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. 5The angel said to the women, \u201cDo not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. 6He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said.

Hebrews 5:1-10; 7:1-28 - For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 2he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness; 3and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself. 4And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was. 5So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, \u201cYou are My Son, Today I have begotten You\u201d; 6just as He says also in another passage, \u201cYou are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201d 7In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety. 8Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. 9And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation, 10being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. - For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually. 4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. 11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him, \u201cYou are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201d 18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, \u201cThe Lord has sworn And will not change His mind, \u2018You are a priest forever\u2019\u2009\u201d); 22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. 23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. 26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.","title":"\u201cministered as a priest (though not a Levite)\u201d"},{"location":"Bibliography/S5Assignment1/#rejected-by-the-jews","text":"O.T.

In theological contexts, verbal interpretation focuses on understanding the specific words in a sacred text, considering grammar, syntax, and the original language to determine meaning. This approach is often used in biblical exegesis to derive meaning from scripture based on the literal wording, often combined with historical and cultural context to aid in proper understanding. In general, verbal interpretation emphasizes: Literal meaning \u2013 Understanding words based on their direct meaning. Grammar and syntax \u2013 Analyzing the structure and form of sentences to derive meaning. Contextual analysis \u2013 Taking into account the broader context to ensure accurate interpretation. This method is different from approaches that might focus more on metaphorical, symbolic, or figurative meanings. Verbal inspiration refers to the doctrine that every word of the Bible is inspired by God, meaning that the Holy Spirit guided the biblical authors to write exactly what God intended, down to the very words used. This concept implies that the original texts of Scripture were not just inspired in their general ideas or themes but in their precise wording as well. Key elements of verbal inspiration include: 1. Plenary inspiration : All parts of Scripture are equally inspired, not just specific sections. 2. Divine guidance : The human authors were directed by the Holy Spirit to ensure that their writings conveyed God's intended message. 3. Inerrancy : Verbal inspiration suggests that, in the original manuscripts, the Bible is without error in all that it affirms. This doctrine is important in theological discussions about the authority, reliability, and interpretation of Scripture, especially in evangelical and conservative Christian traditions. What are the implications of Verbal Inspiration? The doctrine of Verbal Inspiration has several important theological and practical implications, especially regarding how Scripture is understood and applied. Here are key implications: 1. Inerrancy of Scripture Verbal inspiration implies that the Bible, in its original manuscripts, is without error (inerrant) in all that it affirms. This means that everything from historical facts to theological teachings in the Bible is believed to be completely accurate and trustworthy. This inerrancy extends to every word of the Bible, not just the general message or themes. Consequently, biblical interpretation must carefully consider the precise wording, grammar, and structure of Scripture. 2. Authority of Scripture If God inspired every word of the Bible, then the Bible holds ultimate authority over matters of faith, doctrine, and practice. Believers are obligated to submit to the teachings of Scripture as the final and unerring word of God. The verbal inspiration doctrine reinforces the Bible\u2019s position as the supreme rule for Christian life and faith. 3. Literal Interpretation Verbal inspiration often leads to a preference for literal interpretation of Scripture. Since every word is inspired by God, interpreters tend to favor the plain, literal meaning of the text, unless there is clear reason to understand it symbolically or figuratively. This approach is common in conservative evangelical circles, particularly when dealing with historical narratives and prophetic passages. 4. Sufficiency and Completeness Verbal inspiration suggests that the Bible is sufficient for revealing God\u2019s will and plan for humanity. It implies that everything necessary for salvation, faith, and Christian living has been fully revealed in Scripture. This belief discourages reliance on external sources (such as tradition or modern revelations) as equal to or above the authority of Scripture. 5. Impact on Translation and Study If every word of the original manuscripts was divinely inspired, this makes accurate translation and exegesis (critical interpretation) vitally important. Translators and interpreters must strive to preserve the original meaning, paying close attention to grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. It also affects biblical scholarship , where detailed word studies, historical context, and linguistic analysis play a key role in understanding the true meaning of texts. 6. Human and Divine Cooperation Verbal inspiration assumes that while the Bible\u2019s human authors used their own personalities and writing styles, they were guided by the Holy Spirit to write exactly what God intended. This preserves both the human element and divine sovereignty in the writing of Scripture, affirming that the Bible is fully God\u2019s word but communicated through human agents. In summary, the doctrine of verbal inspiration upholds the accuracy, authority, and trustworthiness of the Bible. It affects how Scripture is interpreted, taught, and applied in Christian life, emphasizing the need for careful study and faithful obedience to God\u2019s Word. What does it mean for Bible Study? In the context of Bible study , the doctrine of Verbal Inspiration has several significant implications, influencing how individuals and groups approach Scripture. Here\u2019s how it shapes the study of the Bible: 1. Careful Attention to Words Since verbal inspiration teaches that every word of Scripture is divinely inspired, Bible students place great importance on the specific wording and the exact language of the Bible. This leads to detailed word studies, analysis of original languages (Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic), and careful examination of the text's grammar and syntax. Example: In studying a verse like John 1:1 (\"In the beginning was the Word\"), a verbal inspiration approach encourages delving into the meaning of \"Word\" (Logos in Greek) to fully understand its theological significance. 2. Literal and Contextual Interpretation Verbal inspiration often results in a literal interpretation of Scripture, where passages are understood based on their plain, straightforward meaning, unless the text clearly demands a figurative or symbolic interpretation. Context is also critical. Bible study emphasizes the immediate context (surrounding verses), the broader context (the book as a whole), and the historical and cultural context in which the passage was written. 3. Doctrinal Precision Verbal inspiration shapes Bible study by encouraging a focus on doctrinal accuracy . Because every word is seen as divinely chosen, the process of interpretation demands a careful and precise understanding of Scripture\u2019s theological teachings. Example: In studying doctrines like the Trinity or justification by faith, students of the Bible may examine key verses with attention to exact wording to form a sound doctrinal view. 4. Reliance on Original Languages Since the original Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic texts are considered the inspired words of God, Bible students often emphasize the importance of referring to the original languages to grasp the full meaning of a passage. This can lead to using lexicons, concordances, and commentaries for deeper insights. Example: In Bible study, a word like \"love\" in English might refer to multiple Greek words (agape, phileo, eros) with different meanings, and understanding the difference can change the interpretation of a passage. 5. Exegesis over Eisegesis Verbal inspiration encourages exegesis (drawing out the meaning from the text) rather than eisegesis (reading personal meaning into the text). Since the words themselves are inspired, the goal is to discover what the text actually says rather than impose personal interpretations or cultural biases. Example: When studying the Sermon on the Mount, students would focus on Jesus\u2019 actual words to understand His teaching on ethics and discipleship, rather than adding their own opinions. 6. Application with Confidence Verbal inspiration gives Bible students confidence in applying the Scriptures to their lives. Because the Bible is viewed as the inerrant Word of God, its commands, promises, and teachings can be trusted and applied in practical ways. Example: Verses on forgiveness (like Matthew 6:14-15) are applied with certainty, knowing they reflect God\u2019s will because the very words are divinely inspired. 7. Consistency Across Scripture Since all of Scripture is considered verbally inspired, Bible study often emphasizes the harmony and unity of the Bible. Even though it was written over centuries by different authors, its consistent message is seen as divinely guided. Therefore, verses from different parts of the Bible can help interpret one another. Example: The theme of salvation by faith can be traced and cross-referenced through various books of the Bible, from Genesis to Romans, maintaining a consistent message. Conclusion: For Bible study, verbal inspiration encourages a meticulous and reverent approach to Scripture. It highlights the need for precise interpretation, reliance on the original languages, and a deep commitment to understanding every word as God's inspired truth. This framework ensures that students of the Bible seek to understand Scripture accurately and apply it faithfully. What does it mean for Christian Doctrine? The doctrine of Verbal Inspiration has profound implications for Christian doctrine , particularly regarding how Scripture is viewed in terms of its authority, interpretation, and application. Here\u2019s how verbal inspiration shapes Christian doctrine: 1. Inerrancy of Scripture Verbal inspiration leads to the belief that the Bible is without error in its original manuscripts. Every word is seen as divinely chosen by God, making Scripture entirely trustworthy in all matters it addresses, whether spiritual, historical, or moral. This forms the foundation for the doctrine of biblical inerrancy . Implication: Christian doctrines about creation, sin, salvation, and morality are rooted in the understanding that Scripture is fully reliable and authoritative because God inspired its exact words. Therefore, Scripture is considered a solid foundation for all Christian beliefs. 2. Authority of Scripture Since verbal inspiration affirms that the Bible is God\u2019s literal word, it gives Scripture ultimate authority over all aspects of Christian faith and practice. Doctrinal statements, theological teachings, and moral instructions are all based on the Bible\u2019s inspired words. Implication: Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) becomes central to Christian doctrine, particularly in Protestantism. Scripture is the final rule of faith and practice, and no other source\u2014whether tradition, reason, or personal experience\u2014can supersede the authority of God\u2019s Word. 3. Doctrinal Clarity and Precision Verbal inspiration implies that every word in the Bible is intentional, so doctrines must be derived from the precise wording of Scripture. This fosters a method of interpretation that focuses on doctrinal clarity and precision . Implication: Doctrines such as the Trinity , justification by faith , and the nature of Christ are meticulously developed based on a close examination of specific biblical texts. Verbal inspiration reinforces the importance of formulating doctrines directly from Scripture, ensuring they reflect God\u2019s intended message. 4. Consistency in Doctrine Verbal inspiration supports the view that the entire Bible is internally consistent , since God is its ultimate author. This means that Christian doctrines must be harmonized across all of Scripture. Implication: The doctrine of verbal inspiration leads theologians to believe that any apparent contradictions in Scripture are reconcilable. For example, the doctrine of salvation by faith is consistently affirmed across both the Old and New Testaments. 5. Literal Interpretation and Hermeneutics Verbal inspiration encourages a literal or grammatical-historical approach to interpreting Scripture, which influences how doctrines are developed. Doctrinal conclusions are often drawn from the plain meaning of the text, taking into account the specific words and their historical context. Implication: Christian doctrines about key topics, such as the nature of God , atonement , and eschatology (end times), are developed with careful attention to the literal meaning of the words in the Bible. This approach ensures that doctrines remain faithful to the original intent of the biblical authors. 6. Sufficiency of Scripture Verbal inspiration undergirds the belief in the sufficiency of Scripture for all matters of faith and doctrine. Since every word of the Bible is inspired, Christians believe that the Bible provides everything necessary for salvation, moral living, and understanding God's will. Implication: This doctrine rejects the need for new revelations or external traditions to add to or clarify Scripture. Christian doctrine is seen as complete and unchanging, built on the firm foundation of the inspired Word. 7. Impact on Moral and Ethical Teaching Verbal inspiration also affects how Christian doctrine informs moral and ethical teachings . Since the Bible\u2019s commands and instructions are seen as coming directly from God, they are treated as binding and authoritative. Implication: Ethical doctrines\u2014such as those concerning marriage, sexuality, honesty, and justice\u2014are grounded in the Bible\u2019s inspired words. These doctrines are not open to revision based on cultural changes because they are based on God\u2019s eternal Word. 8. Christological Implications Verbal inspiration emphasizes the centrality of Christ in Christian doctrine. The inspired words of Scripture testify to the person, work, and divinity of Jesus Christ. This leads to a strong emphasis on Christology , the study of the nature and role of Christ. Implication: Doctrines such as the deity of Christ , the incarnation , and the atonement are developed with the understanding that the Bible\u2019s witness to Christ is divinely inspired and completely trustworthy. Summary: For Christian doctrine, the implications of verbal inspiration are profound. It ensures the inerrancy , authority , and sufficiency of Scripture, influencing how doctrines are formed, interpreted, and applied. Doctrinal teachings must align with the precise words of Scripture, leading to a rigorous and consistent approach to theology that is deeply rooted in the belief that the Bible is God's inspired and authoritative Word. What does it mean for Church Practice? The doctrine of Verbal Inspiration significantly influences church practice , shaping everything from worship and preaching to teaching and decision-making. Here\u2019s how verbal inspiration impacts various aspects of church life: 1. Preaching and Teaching Verbal inspiration emphasizes that every word of the Bible is inspired by God, so sermons and teachings are often based on careful, text-centered exposition. Preachers are encouraged to preach expository sermons , where the focus is on explaining the exact meaning of a biblical passage and its application. Implication for practice : Preaching in churches that hold to verbal inspiration focuses on accurately interpreting and applying Scripture, not just personal opinions or topical subjects. Sermon preparation involves deep study of the biblical text, often with attention to original languages. 2. Scripture-Centered Worship Churches that emphasize verbal inspiration often ensure that Scripture is central in worship. This could include: Reading of Scripture : Many churches have the public reading of Scripture during services, often before or after a sermon, as a way of affirming the importance of God\u2019s Word. Singing Scripture : Hymns, songs, and other forms of worship often incorporate biblical phrases, verses, and themes because the words of the Bible are considered divinely inspired. Implication for practice : Worship services are shaped around the Word of God, with an emphasis on Scripture reading, singing biblically grounded songs, and expository preaching . 3. Doctrinal Standards Verbal inspiration means that doctrine must be drawn directly from the Bible. Church creeds, confessions, and doctrinal statements are based on the exact wording of Scripture, as it is believed to be the ultimate authority on matters of faith and practice. Implication for practice : Churches with this view tend to have strong doctrinal commitments based on systematic theology derived from Scripture. They often emphasize adherence to historical creeds (like the Nicene Creed or Apostles' Creed) that are rooted in biblical teaching. 4. Decision-Making and Guidance Churches that hold to verbal inspiration see the Bible as sufficient for providing guidance in both moral and practical decisions. When making decisions, whether about church governance, missions, or pastoral care, Scripture is consulted as the final authority. Implication for practice : Decisions regarding church discipline, leadership, ethical issues, and even finances are made based on biblical principles. Church leaders may focus on the precise words of Scripture for guidance on matters like leadership qualifications (1 Timothy 3, Titus 1) or the handling of disputes (Matthew 18). 5. Discipleship and Christian Education Since every word of Scripture is seen as inspired, church practices around discipleship and education focus heavily on biblical study. This includes: Bible study groups : Church small groups or Sunday schools often engage in detailed study of Scripture to help believers understand and apply the Word of God. Catechism : In some traditions, children and new believers are taught the fundamentals of the faith using catechisms that are based on Scripture, reflecting the church\u2019s commitment to teaching the inspired Word. Implication for practice : Discipleship programs place a high priority on teaching believers to study the Bible carefully, often using resources like Bible commentaries and language tools to understand the inspired text. 6. Church Governance Verbal inspiration influences how churches structure their leadership and governance . Scripture is the basis for determining the roles and responsibilities of pastors, elders, deacons, and other leaders. Implication for practice : Churches may adopt specific forms of governance (such as congregational, presbyterian, or episcopal structures) based on their understanding of biblical teaching about church leadership (e.g., 1 Timothy 3, Acts 6). The qualifications for leaders are also strictly based on the biblical text. 7. Evangelism and Missions Churches that hold to verbal inspiration place a high value on evangelism , believing that the inspired words of the Bible contain the truth needed for salvation. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) is understood as a direct, inspired command from God to share the gospel. Implication for practice : Evangelistic efforts, both locally and globally, are rooted in the belief that sharing the inspired Word of God is essential for leading people to Christ. Missionaries are often trained in Scripture-focused teaching to help spread the gospel. 8. Moral and Ethical Guidance The belief in verbal inspiration means that the Bible provides absolute moral standards . Churches use Scripture to determine ethical positions on issues like marriage, sexuality, social justice, and sanctity of life. Implication for practice : Moral teachings in the church are rooted in a close reading of Scripture. For example, debates over ethical issues such as abortion, marriage, and social justice are grounded in specific biblical teachings (e.g., Genesis 2 for marriage, Psalm 139 for the sanctity of life). Summary: For church practice, the doctrine of verbal inspiration emphasizes the centrality of Scripture in every aspect of church life. From preaching and teaching to governance and ethical decision-making, the Bible is treated as the final and authoritative guide. This approach calls for careful, literal interpretation of Scripture, ensuring that all church practices are aligned with God\u2019s inspired Word. What does it mean for Christian Living? The doctrine of Verbal Inspiration has a significant impact on Christian living because it means that believers view the Bible as the authoritative, inspired Word of God, guiding every aspect of their lives. Here\u2019s how this plays out in Christian practice: 1. Obedience to God's Word Since Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God, they see it as the ultimate standard for how to live. Every command and teaching in Scripture is viewed as authoritative and relevant for daily life. Implication for Christian living : Christians strive to obey the Bible's moral teachings , whether on topics like honesty, purity, forgiveness, or love. For example, commands such as \"love your neighbor\" (Matthew 22:39) or \"do not lie\" (Ephesians 4:25) are treated as binding because they are viewed as God's direct instruction. 2. Shaping of Values and Priorities The belief in verbal inspiration leads Christians to shape their values and priorities according to biblical teachings . Scripture defines what is good, what is worth pursuing, and what is to be avoided. Implication for Christian living : Priorities like serving others , honoring God , and seeking holiness are emphasized because the Bible calls Christians to these things. Verses like Matthew 6:33 (\"seek first His kingdom\") encourage believers to prioritize God\u2019s will over material concerns. 3. Spiritual Growth and Transformation Since the Bible is viewed as God\u2019s inspired Word, it becomes the primary tool for spiritual growth and sanctification . Christians read and meditate on Scripture, believing that through it, the Holy Spirit works to transform their hearts and minds. Implication for Christian living : Regular Bible reading, prayer, and meditation on Scripture become key spiritual disciplines. Verses like Romans 12:2 (\"be transformed by the renewing of your mind\") are understood as calls to let God's inspired Word shape and renew a believer's thinking and behavior. 4. Moral and Ethical Guidance Verbal inspiration means that Christians look to the Bible for moral and ethical guidance in every situation. Since the Bible is considered fully trustworthy, its teachings on issues like marriage, honesty, justice, and integrity are seen as clear directives for how to live. Implication for Christian living : Christians make ethical decisions based on Scripture. For example, they may choose to live out principles like generosity (2 Corinthians 9:7) or kindness (Ephesians 4:32) because the Bible teaches these values. 5. Trust in God's Promises Verbal inspiration encourages believers to trust in the promises of Scripture . Because the Bible is God\u2019s inspired Word, its promises are seen as reliable and trustworthy. Implication for Christian living : Christians rely on verses like Philippians 4:6-7, which promise peace in the midst of anxiety, or Romans 8:28, which promises that God works all things for the good of those who love Him. This gives them comfort and assurance in times of difficulty. 6. Evangelism and Witness Belief in verbal inspiration also drives evangelism . Christians believe the Bible contains the message of salvation, and they share it with others because they see it as the inspired truth that people need for eternal life. Implication for Christian living : Sharing the gospel becomes an essential part of Christian life. Verses like Matthew 28:19-20 (the Great Commission) motivate believers to spread the message of Jesus Christ, as they see it as God's inspired call to mission. 7. Living by Faith Because verbal inspiration means the Bible is God's authoritative Word, Christians live by faith , trusting that what the Bible teaches about God\u2019s character, His will, and His plan for the world is true. Implication for Christian living : Verses like Hebrews 11:1 define faith as the assurance of things hoped for, and believers are encouraged to trust God\u2019s Word in all circumstances, even when life is challenging or uncertain. Summary: The doctrine of verbal inspiration deeply influences Christian living by shaping believers' obedience, values, moral decisions, spiritual growth, and faith. It leads Christians to prioritize Scripture as the final authority on how to live, guiding their daily actions, relationships, and decisions as they seek to follow God's inspired Word.","title":"Verbal"},{"location":"Bibliography/Verbal/#what-are-the-implications-of-verbal-inspiration","text":"The doctrine of Verbal Inspiration has several important theological and practical implications, especially regarding how Scripture is understood and applied.

The General Call The General Call refers to the broad proclamation of the gospel message to all people. It is an invitation extended to everyone to repent, believe in Christ, and receive salvation. However, not everyone who hears this call responds positively; many may reject or ignore it. The General Call is an essential part of evangelism, as it allows the gospel to be heard by all. Scripture References : Matthew 20:16 \"So the last shall be first, and the first last.\" In this context, Jesus speaks about the general nature of the call to follow Him. Many are invited into God's kingdom, but the outcome is determined by how they respond. Matthew 22:14 \"For many are called, but few are chosen.\" This verse highlights the distinction between the General Call that goes out to many and the fact that only some respond in a way that leads to salvation. It indicates that while the invitation is given to all, only those who are \"chosen\" will experience the transforming power of the Effectual Call. Examples of the General Call in Practice : 1. Preaching the Gospel to Crowds : When the gospel is preached publicly, as Jesus did with large crowds or as the apostles did in various cities, it represents the General Call. For example, Peter's sermon in Acts 2 was a General Call to repentance, addressed to everyone listening. 2. Invitations to Repent and Believe : Anytime the gospel message is shared, whether in a church setting, personal evangelism, or through written materials, it constitutes the General Call. The Effectual Call The Effectual Call is the inward call of God, through the Holy Spirit, that leads to a genuine response of faith and repentance. This call is irresistible, meaning that it effectively brings about a change in the person\u2019s heart, enabling them to respond positively to the gospel. Those who receive the Effectual Call will inevitably come to faith in Christ. Scripture References : John 10:27 \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.\" Jesus speaks of His sheep as those who recognize His voice and follow Him. This illustrates the Effectual Call, as it emphasizes that those whom He calls will respond. John 6:66-69 \"As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore. So Jesus said to the twelve, 'You do not want to go away also, do you?' Simon Peter answered Him, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.'\" Peter\u2019s confession here is evidence of the Effectual Call. While many rejected Jesus, those who were called by God recognized the truth and followed Him. Acts 2:1-40 (Focus on verses 37-39) \"Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brethren, what shall we do?' Peter said to them, 'Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'\" The response of the people who were \"pierced to the heart\" indicates the Effectual Call. The Holy Spirit worked in them to produce conviction, leading them to ask how they could be saved. John 3:3 \"Jesus answered and said to him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.'\" The new birth is a result of the Effectual Call. The Holy Spirit enables a person to be \"born again,\" making it possible for them to see and enter the kingdom of God. Romans 10:17 \"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\" While the General Call is made through the preaching of the Word, the Effectual Call occurs when the Holy Spirit works through the preached message to produce saving faith in the hearer. Examples of the Effectual Call in Practice : 1. Conversion Experiences : When an individual hears the gospel and is deeply convicted, leading to a genuine conversion and lifelong commitment to Christ, it is an example of the Effectual Call. 2. The Transformation of the Heart : The Effectual Call involves a change in the person's inner disposition toward God, often described as regeneration or being \"born again\" (John 3:3). Summary of the Distinction: The General Call is outward and goes to everyone; it is resistible, and not all who hear it will respond in faith. The Effectual Call is inward, applied by the Holy Spirit; it is irresistible and brings about a sure response of faith and repentance in those whom God has chosen. These calls work together in God's plan of salvation, with the General Call providing the means by which the gospel is proclaimed, and the Effectual Call ensuring that those whom God has elected will respond to the message.

Scripture is His prime defense. If a discussion about God is to take place then the understanding between all involved is that the Word of God, is in fact, all Truth, inerrant, infallable, immutable, inspired Word of God. The Bible assumes God's existence Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God, Psalm 19:1 \"The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.\" Romans 1:20 \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\" Hebrews 11:6 \"And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.\" Isaiah 45:12 \"It is I who made the earth, and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands and I ordained all their host.\" John 1:1-3 \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.\" Ample evidence for God's existence General Revelation - is evidence for God's existence in the creation. - Romans 1:19-20 \"because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\" Special Revelation - is passed down to us in the bible in three ways: Spoken word, written word, and walking word. We have all of it in the canon of scripture recorded. - Romans 10:17 \"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\" - Isaiah 55:11 \"So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it. Arguments from philosophy (Human Intellect) a priori - Argument strictly taken from reason. Examples - Anselm's argument - also known as the ontological argument, asserts that God, being the greatest conceivable being, must exist in reality because existence is a necessary attribute of greatness. - Descartes's argument - Descartes argues that the very concept of a perfect being (God) implies its existence, as existence is a necessary attribute of perfection. a psteriori - Argument taken as a conclusion from observations. Examples - Clarke's argument, known as the cosmological argument , claims that there must be a necessary being (God) who exists independently and is the cause of all contingent beings, as the existence of the universe requires an uncaused first cause. - Teleological Argument (Argument from Design) : This argument asserts that the order, complexity, and purpose observed in the universe suggest an intelligent designer (God), as natural processes alone are unlikely to produce such intricacies. - Moral Argument : This argument claims that the existence of objective moral values and duties is best explained by the existence of a moral lawgiver (God), as moral laws require a transcendent source. - Conceptual Argument : This is often associated with the idea that the existence of certain concepts, like the concept of God or universals, implies the existence of God or a higher reality, as such concepts need an ultimate grounding beyond human thought.

Human Free Agency Notes Anthropocentric and Theocentric are two terms that describe different perspectives in theology and philosophy: - Anthropocentric (from anthropos , meaning \"human\") refers to a human-centered viewpoint. In theology, it emphasizes humanity's role, needs, and experiences as central. It often focuses on how religious beliefs or practices benefit people or how God relates specifically to human life. - Theocentric (from theos , meaning \"God\") refers to a God-centered viewpoint. This perspective prioritizes God as the central focus of everything, emphasizing His will, glory, and purposes as supreme. In theology, this viewpoint emphasizes God\u2019s sovereignty and the idea that all creation, including humanity, exists to glorify Him.

Use VINES, Robertson\u2019s Word Pictures (RWP), or online word study tools Examine the morphology of each word of the passage and write down anything of note. Morphology Prep: Preposition 3: PERSON indicates the subject of the verb. Third person is the he/she/it/they perspective. I: Imperfect Generally represents continual or repeated action. Where the present tense might indicate \"they are asking,\" the imperfect would indicate \"they kept on asking.\" I: Indictative Is a simple statement of fact. If an action really occurs or has occurred or will occur, it will be rendered in the indicative mood. A: Adjective is a word, phrase, or clause that describes another noun or pronoun and an adjective must agree with its noun or pronoun in GENDER, NUMBER, and CASE. A: Active Represents the subject as the doer or performer of the action. A: Aorist There is no direct or clear English equivalent for this tense, though it is generally rendered as a simple past tense in most translations. A: Accusative The accusative case refers to the case used for a noun or pronoun that is a direct object. G: Genitive The genitive case refers to the case used for a noun, pronoun, or adjective to show description. N: Noun A word denoting anything that can be named, usually an object, person, place, idea, or action. N: Nominative The nominative case refers to the case used for a noun or pronoun when it is the subject of a verb. N: Neuter The gender that includes most words or grammatical forms referring to things classed as neither masculine nor feminine. M: Middle voice Denotes that the subject is both an agent of an action and somehow concerned with the action. D: Demonstrative pronoun Words, such as this and that, used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others. D: Dative The dative case shows the relationship of an indirect object to a verb, often found inside a prepositional phrase. S: Sincular Denoting one person or thing. F: Feminine Denoting a gender of nouns and adjectives, conventionally regarded as female. M: Masculine Denoting a gender of nouns and adjectives, conventionally regarded as male. P: Personal / Possessive Pronoun indicating possession, also known as absolute possessives. T: Difinite Article A definite article indicates specificity. Greek has only one article, which has 24 forms. The Greek article is definite, and it is often (but not always) translated \"the\". It functions very differently from the English \"the\". V: Verb A word or phrase denoting an action. In the Greek language, the verb usually communicates FIVE pieces of information: PERSON, NUMBER, TENSE, MOOD, and VOICE CONJ: Conjuncture A word or phrase that links words, phrases, clauses, or sentences.

Number 50 \u2013 Jubilee and Freedom"},{"location":"Doctrine/PersonalStatement/","text":"Personal Statement of Faith The Message of the Bible God's Kingdom, redeeming His people all for His Glory The Chief End of Man and the Purpose and Providence of God (Chiastic Structure) A. The Glory of God and the Ultimate Purpose of Man I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever, finding our ultimate satisfaction in Him. \"Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory.\" (Isaiah 43:6-7) B. The Goodness and Satisfaction Found in God God is the source of all that is truly good and satisfying. \"O taste and see that the Lord is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!\" (Psalm 34:8) . Our hearts find rest in God alone, \"My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?\" (Psalm 42:2) . \"For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good.\" (Psalm 107:9) C. The Center: God's Sovereign Providence and Our Daily Life I believe in the providence of God, whereby He governs all events according to His eternal plan, upholding all things in heaven and on earth. \"In Him we live and move and have our being.\" (Acts 17:28) . While I am responsible for my actions, His providential care directs my path. Nothing is beyond His control, as He works all things according to the counsel of His will. \"The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps.\" (Proverbs 16:9) . B\u2019. The Rest and Fulfillment Found in God's Presence God provides true joy and fulfillment in His presence, where our deepest longings are met. \"In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever.\" (Psalm 16:11) . Even through every joy and trial, He is near, working all things together for the good of those who love Him. \"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.\" (Romans 8:28) . A\u2019. Living to the Glory of God in All We Do In all aspects of life, we are called to glorify God, giving thanks for His goodness and sovereignty. Our highest calling is to live in worship and obedience to Him, finding our greatest joy in His presence. \"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.\" (1 Corinthians 10:31) . The Bible I believe that the Bible is God\u2019s written revelation to humanity, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments. It is \"inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work\" (2 Timothy 3:16-17) . These Scriptures, being \"spoken from God as men were moved by the Holy Spirit\" (2 Peter 1:21) , are inerrant, infallible, and immutable in their original form, serving as the perfect and authoritative guide for faith and practice. God's Word endures forever, for \"until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished\" (Matthew 5:18) . It is \"truth,\" as Jesus prayed, \"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth\" (John 17:17) . The Bible is to be interpreted literally and contextually, recognizing its historical and grammatical context, such as \"God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day\" (Genesis 1:31) . While there is but one true interpretation of each passage, there are many applications that flow from that interpretation. Believers are called to discern the true meaning of Scripture, guided by the Holy Spirit, so that they may \"prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect\" (Romans 12:2) . The Nature of God I believe that God is eternal, infinite, and unchanging, existing as one essence in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God\" (Psalm 90:2) . He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, possessing all power and knowledge, and \"His sovereignty rules over all\" (Psalm 103:19) . God is perfectly holy and just, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory\" (Isaiah 6:3) , and His judgments are always righteous. God is also good, the source of all that is good, as it is written, \"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!\" (Psalm 34:8) . He is self-existent, declaring, \"I AM WHO I AM\" (Exodus 3:14) , having no beginning or end, and \"His throne is established in the heavens\" (Psalm 103:19) . The Nature of God: Attributes of God Eternal : God exists outside of time, without beginning or end. \"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.\" (Psalm 90:2) Infinite : God is limitless in His presence, knowledge, and power, filling all things. \"Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?\" (Jeremiah 23:24) Immutable : God is unchanging in His nature, character, and promises. \"For I, the Lord, do not change.\" (Malachi 3:6) Omnipotent : I believe that God is sovereign over all creation, doing whatever He pleases in heaven, earth, and the seas. 'For I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods. Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.' (Psalm 135:5-6) Omnipresent : God is present everywhere, and there is no place where He is not. \"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?\" (Psalm 139:7-10) Omniscient : God knows all things, past, present, and future. \"I am God, and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning.\" (Isaiah 46:9-10) Holy : God is absolutely pure, set apart from sin, and perfectly righteous. \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.\" (Isaiah 6:3) Just : God's ways are always right and fair; He is the standard of justice. \"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are just.\" (Deuteronomy 32:4) Good : God is the source of all goodness, and He acts with kindness and mercy. \"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!\" (Psalm 34:8) Sovereign : God exercises supreme authority over all creation. \"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all.\" (Psalm 103:19) Self-existent : God exists by His own power and is dependent on nothing else. \"I AM WHO I AM.\" (Exodus 3:14) The Nature of God: The Trinity The doctrine of the Trinity reveals that there is one God, existing eternally in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The oneness of God is fundamental, affirming that He alone is divine: \"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!\" (Deuteronomy 6:4) . Each person of the Godhead is distinct, yet together they share one divine essence. Jesus affirms this in His command to baptize in the singular name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which shows both their unity and individual persons within the Godhead: \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" (Matthew 28:19) . The unity of essence and distinction of persons are confirmed in John\u2019s epistle, which states, \"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.\" (1 John 5:7) . Additionally, each person of the Trinity maintains a unique relationship with believers and with one another, as expressed in Paul\u2019s benediction: \"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.\" (2 Corinthians 13:14) . The holiness of the Trinity is central to God\u2019s nature, with each person\u2014Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\u2014existing in absolute purity and moral perfection. In heavenly visions, God is worshiped with the thrice-repeated exclamation, \"Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.\" (Revelation 4:8) . This threefold declaration underscores the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, affirming their co-equality in divine holiness. The triune God is the ultimate source and standard of all that is holy, entirely distinct from creation and without any imperfection. Each person of the Trinity is holy. The Father\u2019s holiness is manifested in His complete separation from sin and His inability to approve evil: \"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor.\" (Habakkuk 1:13) . Jesus, the Son, lived a sinless life as the Lamb of God, perfect in purity and blamelessness, who sacrificed Himself to redeem humanity: \"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\" (1 Peter 1:19) . The Holy Spirit, who indwells believers, sanctifies and makes them holy as the temple of God, \"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.\" (1 Corinthians 3:16-17) . The Nature of God: God the Father God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, is the sovereign Creator of all things. \"For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him.\" (1 Corinthians 8:6) . He ordains all things according to His will and purpose, exercising authority over all creation, providence, and redemption. His fatherhood is twofold: He is the Creator and Father of all humanity, \"one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.\" (Ephesians 4:6) , but He is the spiritual Father only to those who are in Christ, having adopted them into His family through faith, \"For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\" (Romans 8:14) . God the Father has decreed all things for His glory and continually upholds and governs all creatures and events, \"Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power\u2026 indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth.\" (1 Chronicles 29:11) . In His holiness, He neither authors nor approves of sin, \"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil.\" (Habakkuk 1:13) , and He preserves the moral accountability of His creation. From eternity past, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His children, \"to the praise of the glory of His grace.\" (Ephesians 1:6) , blessing them with every spiritual blessing in Christ, \"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.\" (Ephesians 1:4) . The Nature of God: God the Son I believe that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, is fully God and fully man, possessing two distinct natures in one person. He is the eternal Son of God, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (John 1:1) . Through Him, all things were created, and He is the radiance of God\u2019s glory, \"upholding all things by the word of His power\" (Hebrews 1:3) . Jesus was born of a virgin (Matthew 1:23), lived a sinless life, and fulfilled the Law perfectly. He willingly went to the cross, \"bearing our sins in His body on the tree\" (1 Peter 2:24) , and died as a substitutionary atonement for humanity\u2019s sins. He rose bodily from the dead on the third day, \"according to the Scriptures\" (1 Corinthians 15:3-4) , conquering sin and death, and ascended into heaven, where He is seated at the right hand of the Father (Hebrews 1:3) . Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, establishing His eternal kingdom, \"for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet\" (1 Corinthians 15:25) . Key Roles and Attributes of God the Son Eternal Sonship: Jesus is eternally God, distinct in person, but equal in essence with the Father. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" (John 1:1) Creator and Sustainer: All things were created through Him and for Him. \"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible.\" (Colossians 1:16) Incarnate Savior: Jesus took on human nature, being born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life. \"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory.\" (John 1:14) Atoning Sacrifice: He died for our sins, taking the penalty we deserved. \"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" (Romans 5:8) Resurrected Lord: Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death. \"He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said.\" (Matthew 28:6) Exalted King: He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. \"He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.\" (Hebrews 1:3) The Nature of God: God the Holy Spirit I believe that the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is fully God, co-equal with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit was active in creation, \"moving over the surface of the waters\" (Genesis 1:2) , and is now the divine agent in regeneration and sanctification. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8) and indwells every believer, sealing them for the day of redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14) . The Holy Spirit empowers believers for service, imparts spiritual gifts, and produces the fruit of the Spirit in their lives. He leads and guides believers into all truth, \"for He will guide you into all the truth\" (John 16:13) , and illuminates the Word of God, enabling its application. Key Roles and Attributes of God the Holy Spirit Divine Person: The Holy Spirit is fully God and co-equal with the Father and Son. \"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\" (2 Corinthians 3:17) Agent of Creation: He was involved in the creation of the world. \"The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.\" (Genesis 1:2) Convictor of Sin: The Holy Spirit brings conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment. \"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment.\" (John 16:8) Indwelling Presence: He resides in all believers, empowering them to live godly lives. \"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?\" (1 Corinthians 3:16) Guide to Truth: He leads believers into understanding and applying God's Word. \"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth.\" (John 16:13) Giver of Spiritual Gifts: The Spirit distributes spiritual gifts for the edification of the Church. \"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.\" (1 Corinthians 12:11) The Decrees of God I believe that the Decrees of God are His eternal ordinances, established in His perfect wisdom and will, by which He determined to accomplish His purposes. These decrees are absolute, sovereign, and unchangeable, encompassing all that will ever happen. Eternal and Unchangeable Plan : From eternity, God has had a plan that does not change, set forth before the foundation of the world. Says the Lord, who makes these things known from long ago (Acts 15:18) just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. (Ephesians 1:4) But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. (2Thes 2:13) . he counsel of the Lord stands forever, The plans of His heart from generation to generation. (Psalms 33:11) Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me, (Isaiah 46:9) Comprehensive Determination of All Things : God comprehends and determines all events that come to pass, working all things according to His sovereign will. \"He works all things after the counsel of His will.\" (Ephesians 1:11) . Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father\u2019s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered (Matt. 10:29-30) \"The king's heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He wishes.\" (Proverbs 21:1) . God\u2019s Relationship to Sin : Although God decrees all things, He is not the author of sin and does not commit evil. God permits sin but always superintends it for His purposes, bringing about His perfect plan. \"This Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men.\" (Acts 2:23) \"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'\" (Job 1:12) Sovereignty and Unconditional Nature : God's decrees are unconditional, independent of human action, and established by His sovereign will. \"He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.\" (Ephesians 1:5) For truly * in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur. (Acts 4:27-28) \"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven.\" (Daniel 4:35) Inevitability and Efficacy of God's Will : The decrees of God are by His sovereign will, and nothing can hinder them. 'Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.' (Psalm 135:6) For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. (Eph. 2:10) \"For who can resist His will?\" (Romans 9:19) \"My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.\" (Isaiah 46:10, ESV) Consistency with God's Holy Nature : God's decrees are always perfectly consistent with His holy character. He remains pure and righteous in all His plans. \"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor.\" (Habakkuk 1:13) What I Believe About Angels I believe that angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve as His messengers and to accomplish His will. The term \"angel\" means \"messenger,\" and while it may refer to other functions, it primarily describes their role in delivering God's messages or worshiping Him. \"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?\" (Hebrews 1:14) . Angels were created at a specific time by God, before the creation of humanity, to reflect His glory. \"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible.\" (Colossians 1:16) . They are not eternal like God but exist as immortal beings. \"For they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.\" (Luke 20:36) . Angels were created in great numbers and existed before the foundation of the world, rejoicing at the creation of the earth. \"When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\" (Job 38:7) . They are a higher order of beings than humans, possessing greater strength and knowledge. \"What is man that You take thought of him? Yet You have made him a little lower than the angels.\" (Psalm 8:4-5) . Angels are often referred to as the \"Host of Heaven,\" symbolizing their role in God's heavenly army. \"I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.\" (2 Chronicles 18:18) . Roles and Classes of Angels Michael the Archangel is a warrior angel who defends God's people. \"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil...\" (Jude 1:9) . Gabriel is a messenger angel, delivering significant announcements. \"I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.\" (Luke 1:19) . Seraphim worship God and guard His throne. \"Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings... and one called out to another and said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts.'\" (Isaiah 6:2-3) . Cherubim guard sacred places, such as the Garden of Eden, the Shekinah Glory of God, and the mercy seat of God. \"So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim.\" (Genesis 3:24) . Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them. (Eze 11:22) and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail. (Heb 9:5) Destiny of Angels Angels will live eternally, either in God's presence or, for the fallen angels, in the Lake of Fire. \"Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.\" (Matthew 25:41) . What I Believe About Satan I believe that Satan is a real and personal being, a fallen angel who actively opposes God and His purposes. He is referred to as \"a murderer from the beginning... and the father of lies,\" (John 8:44) . His name, \"Satan,\" meaning \"adversary,\" reflects his opposition to God's work, while other titles such as \"the devil\" (slanderer) and \"Beelzebub\" (lord of the flies) emphasize his malicious nature and intent to deceive and destroy. Originally, Satan was created as a beautiful and powerful cherumbin, endowed with wisdom and splendor. \"You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.\" (Ezekiel 28:12-14) . However, pride led to his downfall as he sought to elevate himself above God. \"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor.\" (Ezekiel 28:17) . In his rebellion, Satan deceived a third of the angels to follow him, who are now his demons. \"His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth.\" (Revelation 12:4) . Though Satan wields significant power, he is neither omnipotent nor omnipresent and remains subject to God\u2019s sovereign control. \"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'\" (Job 1:12) . Believers are called to resist Satan\u2019s influence by submitting to God. \"Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.\" (James 4:7) . Demons, the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion, also work to deceive, influence, and harm humanity, blinding the minds of unbelievers, \"The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving.\" (2 Corinthians 4:4) . Satan\u2019s defeat was accomplished through the death and resurrection of Christ, who declared victory over him. \"The ruler of this world has been judged.\" (John 16:11) . Ultimately, Satan\u2019s final destiny is the Lake of Fire, where he and his demons will suffer eternal punishment. \"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone.\" (Revelation 20:10) . What I Believe About the Nature of Man I believe that humanity was created uniquely by God in His image. \"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky.'\" (Genesis 1:26-27) . This image is not a literal or exact representation but reflects God's attributes in a finite and limited way. In our original state, Adam and Eve were without sin and enjoyed a perfect relationship with God. \"Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.\" (Genesis 2:7) . \"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.\" (Genesis 2:21-22) . Man's nature consisted of both a physical body and an immaterial soul or spirit. \"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:23) . However, through the Fall, humanity's moral and spiritual likeness to God has been corrupted, resulting in the universal sinfulness of all people. \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" (Romans 3:23) . Yet, through Christ, the image of God is being restored in believers, and it will be perfected at His return. \"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.\" (2 Corinthians 3:18) . \"Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.\" (1 Corinthians 15:49) . What I Believe About Sin I believe that sin is any failure to conform to God\u2019s moral law in action, attitude, or nature. Sin originated with Satan's rebellion against God and entered humanity through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. \"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned.\" (Romans 5:12) . Sin separates us from God, corrupting the image of God in us and resulting in both physical and spiritual death. \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" (Romans 6:23) . The origin of sin lies in Satan's initial rebellion, followed by the fall of humanity. Created as a powerful angel, Satan became corrupted by pride, \"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty.\" (Ezekiel 28:17) , and subsequently led Adam and Eve into disobedience, as they ate from the forbidden tree. All descendants of Adam inherit this sinful nature, inclining us toward sin from birth, \"There is none righteous, not even one.\" (Romans 3:10) . Sin pervades every part of our being\u2014mind, will, and emotions\u2014leaving humanity incapable of pleasing God apart from His grace. \"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?\" (Jeremiah 17:9) . Sin has devastating consequences. It creates a barrier between humanity and God, disrupting the relationship we were made to enjoy with Him, \"Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God.\" (Isaiah 59:2) . Beyond spiritual death, sin also affects creation itself, which now suffers under a curse, \"For the creation was subjected to futility.\" (Romans 8:20) . Different types of sin include original sin , the inherited sinful nature from Adam, personal sins committed by each individual, and sins of commission and omission \u2014acts of disobedience as well as failures to act in righteousness. \"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" (1 John 1:8) . God has provided the ultimate remedy for sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus bore our sins and offers redemption to all who believe in Him, \"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross.\" (1 Peter 2:24) . In Christ, believers are called to confess their sins and find forgiveness, \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" (1 John 1:9) , with the promise of being conformed to His image, \"We all... are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.\" (2 Corinthians 3:18) . For those in Christ, victory over sin is achieved through the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to live in righteousness and pursue ongoing sanctification, \"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.\" (Romans 6:14) . This sanctification process continues throughout life, as God works in believers to make them more like His Son, \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification.\" (1 Thessalonians 4:3) . Salvation (Soteriology) I believe that Salvation is a gracious gift from God, given by His mercy and not earned by human effort. It is received through faith in Jesus Christ alone , who accomplished our redemption through His life, death, and resurrection. Salvation is entirely of grace, based on the work of Christ, and applied by the Holy Spirit. As Scripture declares, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" (Ephesians 2:8-9). The Basis of Salvation By Grace Alone : Salvation is entirely an act of God's grace, undeserved and unearned. \"He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit.\" (Titus 3:5) Through Faith Alone : It is accessed solely through faith, trusting in Christ's finished work on the cross. \"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (Romans 5:1) \"For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.\" (Romans 3:28) In Christ Alone : Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity. His sacrificial death and victorious resurrection secured our salvation. \"There is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.\" (Acts 4:12) \"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God.\" (1 Peter 3:18) The Process of Salvation Election : God's choice of certain individuals for salvation was made before the foundation of the world. \"He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.\" (Ephesians 1:4) Regeneration : The work of the Holy Spirit in giving new spiritual life to the believer. \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" (John 3:3) \"He saved us... by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit.\" (Titus 3:5) Justification : The act of God declaring a sinner righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness. \"Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.\" (Romans 3:24) \"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\" (2 Corinthians 5:21) Sanctification : The ongoing process of being made holy, conformed to the image of Christ. \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification.\" (1 Thessalonians 4:3) \"We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.\" (2 Corinthians 3:18) Glorification : The final step of salvation, where believers are fully conformed to the likeness of Christ and free from the presence of sin. \"Whom He predestined, He also called; and whom He called, He also justified; and whom He justified, He also glorified.\" (Romans 8:30) The Result of Salvation Salvation brings about reconciliation with God, adoption as His children, and eternal life. Believers are united with Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and assured of eternal security. \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16). We are saved to the glory of God alone, for His purpose and praise. \"To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling... to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory.\" (Jude 1:24-25). The Church I believe that the Church is the body of Christ, a spiritual organism made up of all believers from the day of Pentecost to the Rapture. It is composed of those who have been called out by God from all nations to form one unified body, \"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.\" (1 Corinthians 12:13) . The Church is distinct from Israel and was established as a new entity at Pentecost. The Universal and Local Church The universal Church consists of all true believers in Christ, forming a spiritual body where Christ is the head, \"And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.\" (Ephesians 1:22-23) . The local church refers to the visible gathering of believers in a specific location, committed to the teaching of God's Word, worship, fellowship, and observing the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper, \"They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.\" (Acts 2:42) . The Purpose of the Church The Church exists to glorify God by making His wisdom known, \"so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\" (Ephesians 3:10) , and to be a dwelling place for God by the Spirit, \"being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.\" (Ephesians 2:20-21) . The Functions of the Church Worship : The Church gathers to praise and honor God, \"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.\" (John 4:24) . Evangelism : The Church is commanded to spread the gospel to all nations, \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" (Matthew 28:19) . Discipleship : The Church is tasked with teaching believers to grow in maturity, \"Teaching them to observe all that I commanded you.\" (Matthew 28:20) . Fellowship and Care : The Church is to care for its members, \"Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.\" (Galatians 6:2) . The Future of the Church The Church's future includes being raptured, rewarded, and reigning with Christ, \"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout...and the dead in Christ will rise first.\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17) . Eventually, the Church will dwell with Christ in the New Jerusalem, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them.\" (Revelation 21:3) . Heaven and Hell I believe that Heaven and Hell are real and eternal destinations for all human beings after death. The existence of these places is clearly revealed in Scripture, and they reflect the ultimate outcomes of God's justice and grace. Heaven Heaven is the eternal dwelling place of God, His elect angels, and all believers who have been redeemed through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a place of perfect peace, joy, and fellowship with God, where there is no more pain, suffering, or death. Scripture describes Heaven as the \"Third Heaven,\" the sacred abode of God, \"where God dwells and receives worship\" (2 Corinthians 12:2-4) . In Heaven, God\u2019s sovereignty and holiness are fully realized, \"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all.\" (Psalm 103:19) . For believers, Heaven offers the blessed hope of being in the Lord\u2019s presence immediately upon death, \"To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.\" (2 Corinthians 5:8) . In the eternal state, Heaven will come down to the new earth as the New Jerusalem, where God will dwell with His people in a new and glorious creation, \"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.\" (Revelation 21:2) . Heaven is also referred to as Paradise , a place of blessedness for the righteous. Following Christ\u2019s ascension, Paradise shifted from Abraham's Bosom to the Third Heaven, and now, believers who die are taken to Heaven to be with the Lord. Hell Hell is the present place of torment for the souls of the unrighteous, serving as a temporary state of suffering until the final judgment. Often referred to in Scripture as Hades (the Greek equivalent of Sheol ), Hell is described as the realm of the dead, where the wicked await their ultimate fate. It is a place of conscious torment, as Jesus illustrated in the story of the rich man in Hades: \"In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment.\" (Luke 16:23) . The souls in Hell experience ongoing suffering and regret, \"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" (Matthew 13:42) . This place is reserved for those who have turned away from God, \"The wicked will return to Sheol, even all the nations who forget God.\" (Psalm 9:17) . Hell reflects God\u2019s justice and the reality of separation from His presence for those who reject His salvation. The Lake of Fire (Gehenna) The Lake of Fire , also known as Gehenna , is the final and eternal destination for the unrighteous following the final judgment. Unlike Hell (Hades), which is temporary, the Lake of Fire is a place of eternal punishment and separation from God, prepared for both fallen angels and humans who reject Christ. Scripture describes it as a place of unquenchable fire and utter darkness, \"It is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.\" (Mark 9:43) . This eternal separation from God is the ultimate penalty for sin, \"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord.\" (2 Thessalonians 1:9) . At the final judgment, those not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into this Lake of Fire, \"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\" (Revelation 20:15) , marking an irreversible state of separation and suffering in God\u2019s final judgment against sin. The Resurrection I believe that the Resurrection is a multi-stage event in God's redemptive plan, ultimately bringing believers into eternal life with glorified bodies. It is central to the hope of the Christian faith and is described as taking place during what is often referred to as the Rapture . According to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 , this event encompasses the resurrection of the dead in Christ and the transformation of living believers. \"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17) . The Phases of the Resurrection The Resurrection of the Dead in Christ : At the Lord's return, those who have died in Christ will be raised with new, glorified bodies, \"The dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.\" (1 Corinthians 15:52) . This resurrection marks the beginning of the fulfillment of immortality for the redeemed. The Transformation of Living Believers : Those who are alive at the time of Christ\u2019s return will be transformed instantly, \"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.\" (1 Corinthians 15:52) . This reference to the last trumpet is often associated with Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year), known as the Feast of Trumpets , during which multiple trumpet blasts (shofar blasts) are sounded. The final, long blast called the Tekiah Gedolah is significant because it symbolizes awakening, repentance, and the anticipation of God's coming redemption. This connection enriches the understanding of the resurrection as a time of transformation and renewal, heralding Christ's return and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The Bema Seat of Christ : Following the resurrection and transformation, believers will appear before the Bema Seat of Christ , where their works will be evaluated, and rewards will be given. This judgment is for the purpose of reward, not condemnation, \"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body.\" (2 Corinthians 5:10) . The Significance of the Resurrection The resurrection fulfills the promise of eternal life and victory over death. \"For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.\" (1 Corinthians 15:53) . It is a demonstration of Christ's power over death and a guarantee of the believer's future glorification. Through this event, the saints will experience the fullness of their salvation as they are conformed to the image of Christ. The Judgment I believe that Judgment is an essential aspect of God's character and His ultimate plan of justice. Scripture reveals that every person will face judgment before God, who judges with perfect righteousness. \"For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God\u2026So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.\" (Romans 14:10,12) . This includes both believers and unbelievers, with distinct judgments that reveal God's justice, holiness, and sovereignty. Judgment for Believers: The Bema Seat of Christ Believers will appear before the Bema Seat of Christ (the Judgment Seat of Christ) to receive rewards for their faithful service. Purpose : The Bema Seat is to evaluate believers' lives and reward them according to their works, \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\" (Ephesians 2:10) . Rewards : The rewards given at the Bema Seat reflect God\u2019s recognition of the believer\u2019s faithfulness, \"Each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.\" (1 Corinthians 3:13) . Believers are rewarded with crowns and other blessings, \"And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.\" (1 Peter 5:4) . Judgment for Unbelievers: The Great White Throne Unbelievers will face final judgment at the Great White Throne , where they will be judged for their rejection of Christ and their deeds. This judgment is one of condemnation, resulting in eternal separation from God. The Great White Throne : At the end of the age, those who have rejected God will stand before Him for judgment. \"Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away.\" (Revelation 20:11) . The Book of Life : Those not found in the Book of Life will face eternal punishment, \"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\" (Revelation 20:15) . Final Destination : Unbelievers will be cast into the Lake of Fire , which is the second death, \"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\" (Matthew 25:46) . The Judgment of Angels God will also judge angels who rebelled with Satan. \"And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day.\" (Jude 1:6) . These fallen angels, along with Satan, will face eternal punishment, \"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone.\" (Revelation 20:10) . The Nature of God\u2019s Judgment God\u2019s judgment flows from His perfect holiness and righteousness. He is a holy and just Judge who cannot tolerate sin in His presence, as His nature is pure and blameless. \"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor.\" (Habakkuk 1:13) . As a just God, He judges all people according to His perfect standards. God\u2019s Righteousness: God\u2019s judgment is based on His unchanging righteousness; His standards are flawless, and His judgments are just. \"The Lord is righteous, He loves righteousness; the upright will behold His face.\" (Psalm 11:7) . God\u2019s Holiness: Because God is holy, He cannot be in the presence of sin or overlook unrighteousness. His holiness demands that He judge sin, upholding His blameless character. \"The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He.\" (Deuteronomy 32:4) . God\u2019s Justice: God's justice ensures that each person is held accountable for their actions. His judgments are fair and unchangeable, offering mercy to those covered by Christ\u2019s atonement, while condemning sin and rebellion in those who reject Him. \"For the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for Him.\" (Isaiah 30:18) . The Final Judgment and Eternal Destinies The final judgment is the culmination of God\u2019s redemptive plan, where all creation is held accountable before Him. Believers will experience eternal life in the presence of God, while unbelievers face eternal separation from Him. Eternal Life : Believers are promised eternal life with God in the New Heaven and New Earth, \"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain.\" (Revelation 21:4) . Eternal Separation : For those who reject God, eternal separation is their end, \"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord.\" (2 Thessalonians 1:9) . The Second Coming of the Messiah I believe that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the Messiah , will occur at a time when it is not anticipated, as Scripture says, \"For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:2) . His return will be visible, physical, and triumphant, just as He ascended. \"They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.\" (Matthew 24:30) . \"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.\" (Matthew 24:27) . Upon His return, Christ will bring final judgment to all nations, gathering them before Him as He sits on His glorious throne. \"When the Son of Man comes in His glory... He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them one from another.\" (Matthew 25:31-32) . He will establish His eternal kingdom, fulfilling God\u2019s plan of redemption. \"The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.\" (Revelation 11:15) . At the culmination of this redemptive plan, Christ will defeat all evil, casting Satan and his forces into the Lake of Fire. \"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone.\" (Revelation 20:10) . The Second Coming of Christ is the blessed hope of all believers, as we eagerly await \"the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.\" (Titus 2:13) . Eternity I believe that eternity is the final state of existence for all souls, where time, as we know it, ceases, and each person experiences a permanent, unchanging destiny. The Scriptures reveal two eternal destinations: eternal life in the presence of God for believers and eternal separation from God for those who reject Him. \"And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\" (Matthew 25:46) . Eternal Life with God For believers, eternity means everlasting life in the presence of God . This life is one of unbroken fellowship, worship, and joy, free from sin, suffering, and death. \"And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them.'\" (Revelation 21:3) , and is the fulfillment of God\u2019s promises and the ultimate hope of the Christian faith. \"And thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.\" (1 Thessalonians 4:17-18) . The New Heaven and New Earth : God will create a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells and all things are made new. \"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away.\" (Revelation 21:1) . The Absence of Suffering : In eternity with God, there will be no more pain, sorrow, or death. \"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain.\" (Revelation 21:4) . Eternal Separation from God For those who reject God, eternity means eternal separation from Him in a place of suffering. This separation is final and irreversible, marking a state of conscious existence apart from God\u2019s goodness and grace. \"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.\" (2 Thessalonians 1:9) . The Lake of Fire : Unbelievers face eternity in the Lake of Fire, a place of punishment originally prepared for the devil and his angels. \"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\" (Revelation 20:15) . Eternal Conscious Punishment : The suffering of eternal separation is continuous, and the consequences of sin remain without end. \"Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.\" (Mark 9:48) .","title":"Personal Statement of Faith"},{"location":"Doctrine/PersonalStatement/#personal-statement-of-faith","text":"","title":"Personal Statement of Faith"},{"location":"Doctrine/PersonalStatement/#the-message-of-the-bible","text":"God's Kingdom, redeeming His people all for His Glory","title":"The Message of the Bible"},{"location":"Doctrine/PersonalStatement/#the-chief-end-of-man-and-the-purpose-and-providence-of-god-chiastic-structure","text":"A.

The oneness of God is fundamental, affirming that He alone is divine: \"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!\" (Deuteronomy 6:4) . Each person of the Godhead is distinct, yet together they share one divine essence. Jesus affirms this in His command to baptize in the singular name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which shows both their unity and individual persons within the Godhead: \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\" (Matthew 28:19) . The unity of essence and distinction of persons are confirmed in John\u2019s epistle, which states, \"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.\" (1 John 5:7) . Additionally, each person of the Trinity maintains a unique relationship with believers and with one another, as expressed in Paul\u2019s benediction: \"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.\" (2 Corinthians 13:14) . The holiness of the Trinity is central to God\u2019s nature, with each person\u2014Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\u2014existing in absolute purity and moral perfection. In heavenly visions, God is worshiped with the thrice-repeated exclamation, \"Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.\" (Revelation 4:8) . This threefold declaration underscores the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, affirming their co-equality in divine holiness. The triune God is the ultimate source and standard of all that is holy, entirely distinct from creation and without any imperfection. Each person of the Trinity is holy. The Father\u2019s holiness is manifested in His complete separation from sin and His inability to approve evil: \"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor.\" (Habakkuk 1:13) .

In our original state, Adam and Eve were without sin and enjoyed a perfect relationship with God. \"Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.\" (Genesis 2:7) . \"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.\" (Genesis 2:21-22) . Man's nature consisted of both a physical body and an immaterial soul or spirit. \"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:23) . However, through the Fall, humanity's moral and spiritual likeness to God has been corrupted, resulting in the universal sinfulness of all people. \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" (Romans 3:23) . Yet, through Christ, the image of God is being restored in believers, and it will be perfected at His return. \"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.\" (2 Corinthians 3:18) . \"Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.\" (1 Corinthians 15:49) .","title":"What I Believe About the Nature of Man"},{"location":"Doctrine/PersonalStatement/#what-i-believe-about-sin","text":"I believe that sin is any failure to conform to God\u2019s moral law in action, attitude, or nature. Sin originated with Satan's rebellion against God and entered humanity through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. \"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned.\" (Romans 5:12) . Sin separates us from God, corrupting the image of God in us and resulting in both physical and spiritual death. \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" (Romans 6:23) . The origin of sin lies in Satan's initial rebellion, followed by the fall of humanity. Created as a powerful angel, Satan became corrupted by pride, \"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty.\" (Ezekiel 28:17) , and subsequently led Adam and Eve into disobedience, as they ate from the forbidden tree. All descendants of Adam inherit this sinful nature, inclining us toward sin from birth, \"There is none righteous, not even one.\" (Romans 3:10) . Sin pervades every part of our being\u2014mind, will, and emotions\u2014leaving humanity incapable of pleasing God apart from His grace. \"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?\" (Jeremiah 17:9) . Sin has devastating consequences. It creates a barrier between humanity and God, disrupting the relationship we were made to enjoy with Him, \"Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God.\" (Isaiah 59:2) . Beyond spiritual death, sin also affects creation itself, which now suffers under a curse, \"For the creation was subjected to futility.\" (Romans 8:20) . Different types of sin include original sin , the inherited sinful nature from Adam, personal sins committed by each individual, and sins of commission and omission \u2014acts of disobedience as well as failures to act in righteousness. \"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" (1 John 1:8) . God has provided the ultimate remedy for sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus bore our sins and offers redemption to all who believe in Him, \"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross.\" (1 Peter 2:24) . In Christ, believers are called to confess their sins and find forgiveness, \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" (1 John 1:9) , with the promise of being conformed to His image, \"We all... are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.\" (2 Corinthians 3:18) . For those in Christ, victory over sin is achieved through the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to live in righteousness and pursue ongoing sanctification, \"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.\" (Romans 6:14) . This sanctification process continues throughout life, as God works in believers to make them more like His Son, \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification.\" (1 Thessalonians 4:3) .","title":"What I Believe About Sin"},{"location":"Doctrine/PersonalStatement/#salvation-soteriology","text":"I believe that Salvation is a gracious gift from God, given by His mercy and not earned by human effort.

Each view approaches the fulfillment and timeline of biblical prophecy differently. Below are some of the major perspectives: 1. Preterist View Definition : The Preterist view holds that most or all of the Bible\u2019s prophecies, especially those in the Book of Revelation and the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24), were fulfilled in the first century, particularly with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Key Beliefs : Prophecies such as the coming of the Son of Man, tribulation, and the end times primarily refer to events in ancient history. The \"end of the world\" or \"end of the age\" refers to the end of the Jewish temple system, not the literal end of the world. Variations : Partial Preterism : Some prophecies were fulfilled in the first century, but others (like the Second Coming) are still future. Full Preterism : All prophecies were fulfilled by the end of the first century. 2. Historicist View Definition : The Historicist view interprets biblical prophecy as an unfolding series of events throughout history, from the time of the writing of the Bible to the end of the world. Key Beliefs : Prophecies represent major historical events such as the rise of the Roman Empire, the Reformation, and even modern-day events. The Book of Revelation is seen as a prophetic timeline that spans from the early church to the Second Coming of Christ. Commonly Held By : Early Protestant reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin interpreted Revelation in this manner, seeing the papacy as the Antichrist figure. 3. Futurist View Definition : The Futurist view holds that most of the events described in biblical prophecy, particularly in Revelation and Daniel, have not yet occurred and will take place in the future. Key Beliefs : The prophecies describe literal future events, such as the rise of the Antichrist, a seven-year tribulation, and Christ\u2019s Second Coming. The events of the end times will happen in a short, catastrophic period rather than over a long period of history. Commonly Held By : Many Evangelical Christians, especially those who adhere to Dispensationalism, which divides history into distinct periods or \"dispensations.\" 4. Idealist (or Symbolic) View Definition : The Idealist view interprets the Bible\u2019s prophecies, especially those in Revelation, as symbolic representations of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, rather than specific historical events. Key Beliefs : The events in the Bible symbolize the spiritual battle between Christ and Satan that occurs throughout all of human history. The focus is on timeless moral and theological lessons rather than specific prophetic fulfillments. Commonly Held By : Some Christian theologians and scholars who emphasize a spiritual or allegorical reading of prophecy. 5. Dispensationalist View Definition : Dispensationalism is a specific form of Futurism that divides human history into different periods or \"dispensations\" in which God deals with humanity in distinct ways. Key Beliefs : Prophecy is largely futuristic and includes events such as the Rapture, a seven-year tribulation, the return of Christ, and the establishment of a literal thousand-year reign (the Millennium). Distinguishes between God\u2019s plan for Israel and the church, seeing the church age as a temporary interruption in God\u2019s plan for Israel. Commonly Held By : Many American Evangelicals and proponents of the \"Left Behind\" series of books. 6. Covenant Theology View Definition : Covenant theology views biblical history as governed by covenants between God and humanity, rather than distinct dispensations. Key Beliefs : Biblical prophecy should be interpreted in light of the overarching covenantal relationship between God and His people. The church has replaced Israel in God's plan, and thus many prophecies about Israel are fulfilled in the church. Prophecy is often seen as either preterist or idealist in nature, focusing on spiritual fulfillment rather than specific future events. Commonly Held By : Reformed and Presbyterian traditions. Summary of Views on Bible Prophecy: Preterist : Most prophecies were fulfilled in the first century. Historicist : Prophecies are being fulfilled throughout church history. Futurist : Most prophecies are yet to be fulfilled in the future. Idealist : Prophecies are symbolic and teach spiritual truths, not literal events. Dispensationalist : A specific form of futurism emphasizing distinct periods in God's dealings with humanity.

The \"end of the world\" or \"end of the age\" refers to the end of the Jewish temple system, not the literal end of the world.

That God is eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity is fully God and fully distinct. The triune nature of God is not in conflict with His unity, despite the difficulty we humans have of comprehending it. Is it possible for us, while in our flesh, to understand the Trinity? Why or why not? : our minds are not capable of comprehending this Soteriology Election Eph 1:3-6 - just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. Regeneration Eph 2:5 - But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) Atonement Rom. 5:6; 8,9 - For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. Redemption Rom. 6:17;22 - But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed, But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. Propitiation 1 John 2:2-3; 4:10 - we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; 2and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. Describe the role of each member of the Trinity with regard to salvation. God the Father is responsible for election. God the Son is responsible forthe atonement and the sanctification of the saints. God the Holy Spirit is responsible for regeneration and testifying of Jesus. Compare and contrast Pelagianism, Arminianism and Calvinism with respect to salvation. Pelagianism asserts that human beings are completely capable of choosing to come to Christ on their own without aid of the Holy Spirit. Arminianism asserts that while the Holy Spirit makes it possible for somebody to come to faith, the individual must cooperate with the Holy Spirit and has the ability to refuse the offer of salvation.

Divisions in the Church vs. 1:10-4:21 In Chapter 1, Paul greets the Corinthian church, expressing gratitude for the grace of God given to them in Christ Jesus and addressing divisions among them ( vs. 1-13 ). He emphasizes that the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but the power of God to those being saved ( vs. 18 ), and highlights God\u2019s wisdom in choosing the foolish and weak to shame the wise and strong ( vs. 27-29 ). Christ is presented as the power and wisdom of God, who unites believers and sanctifies them ( vs. 24, 30 ). Believers should strive for unity in the church ( vs. 10 ), boast only in the Lord ( vs. 31 ), and live as those called to fellowship with Christ ( vs. 9 ). In Chapter 2, Paul explains that he came to the Corinthians not with eloquence or worldly wisdom, but proclaiming Jesus Christ and Him crucified ( vs. 1-5 ). He contrasts the wisdom of this age with the wisdom of God, revealed through the Spirit, and declares that \u201cthe natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him\u201d ( vs. 14 ). Christ is presented as the crucified Savior, through whom God\u2019s wisdom and mystery are revealed to believers ( vs. 7-8 ). Believers should rely on the Spirit for understanding ( vs. 10 ), avoid boasting in human wisdom, and embrace the mind of Christ ( vs. 16 ). In Chapter 3, Paul addresses the Corinthians' divisions and reminds them that believers are God\u2019s field and building, with Christ as the only foundation ( vs. 6-11 ). He warns that each one\u2019s works will be tested by fire: \u201cgold, silver, and precious stones\u201d will endure, but \u201cwood, hay, and straw\u201d will be burned up, revealing the quality of their labor ( vs. 12-15 ). Christ is presented as the foundation upon which all spiritual work must be built to have lasting, eternal value ( vs. 11 ). Believers should build wisely, recognizing that they are the temple of God where the Holy Spirit dwells ( vs. 16-17 ), and live in a way that reflects God\u2019s holiness. In Chapter 4, Paul emphasizes that apostles and ministers of Christ are stewards of the mysteries of God, and their primary responsibility is to be faithful ( vs. 1-2 ). He warns against judging prematurely, reminding the Corinthians that \u201ceach one\u2019s praise will come to him from God\u201d when the Lord returns ( vs. 5 ). Christ is presented as the Lord who will bring to light what is hidden and judge the hearts of all ( vs. 5 ). Believers should refrain from pride and boasting in human leaders ( vs. 6 ), imitate the humility of Christ\u2019s servants ( vs. 16 ), and live as faithful stewards accountable to God. III. Sins of the Church vs. 5:1-6:20 In Chapter 5, Paul confronts the church for tolerating sexual immorality, specifically a case of incest, and calls for the removal of the offender from the community ( vs. 1-2 ). He emphasizes that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, urging the Corinthians to remove sin from their midst to be a new, unleavened batch, as Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed ( vs. 6-8 ). Christ is presented as the Passover Lamb whose sacrifice calls believers to holiness and purity ( vs. 7 ). Believers should mourn over sin, purge evil from among them ( vs. 2, 13 ), and live as a sanctified community in sincerity and truth ( vs. 8 ). In Chapter 6, Paul rebukes the Corinthians for settling disputes in secular courts and reminds them that believers, sanctified and justified in Christ, are called to judge with godly wisdom ( vv. 1\u20136, 11 ). He warns against sins like sexual immorality and idolatry, emphasizing that their bodies, as temples of the Holy Spirit, must glorify God, for they were bought with a price ( vv. 9\u201320 ). Christ is presented as the one who justifies and sanctifies believers through His name ( v. 11 ), Believers should flee from sexual immorality and glorify God in their bodies ( vv. 18\u201320 ). IV. Problems of the Church vs. 7:1-15:58 In Chapter 7, Paul addresses questions about marriage, singleness, and divorce, emphasizing that each person should live according to the calling they have received from God ( vv. 1, 17 ). He teaches that marriage is a safeguard against immorality, but those who are single can devote themselves more fully to the Lord ( vv. 2, 32\u201335 ). Paul allows for divorce only in specific cases and encourages believers to remain in their current circumstances, whether married, single, or enslaved, as they serve the Lord ( vv. 10\u201324 ). Christ is presented as the Lord who calls each believer to live faithfully in their assigned circumstances ( vv. 17, 24 ), Believers should honor God in their marital and personal relationships and remain faithful to the Lord\u2019s calling in their lives ( vv. 17, 35 ). In Chapter 8, Paul discusses the issue of eating food sacrificed to idols, emphasizing that while knowledge can lead to freedom, love should guide believers' actions to avoid causing others to stumble ( vv. 1\u20133, 9 ). He explains that idols have no real existence and that there is only one God, yet some believers with weaker consciences may still view such practices as sinful ( vv. 4\u20137 ). Paul urges the Corinthians to prioritize the spiritual well-being of others over their own rights, avoiding behavior that might lead a weaker brother or sister into sin ( vv. 9\u201313 ). Christ is presented as the one through whom all things exist and who strengthens believers to live in love ( v. 6 ), Believers should act in love, building up others and avoiding actions that harm their faith ( vv. 1, 9, 13 ). In Chapter 9, Paul defends his rights as an apostle, explaining that while he has the right to financial support, he willingly forgoes it to avoid hindering the gospel ( vv. 1\u201315 ). He emphasizes his commitment to preaching the gospel free of charge and becoming all things to all people to save some ( vv. 16\u201323 ). Paul likens the Christian life to a race, urging believers to exercise self-discipline and strive for an imperishable crown ( vv. 24\u201327 ). Christ is presented as the source of the gospel and the ultimate goal of faithful service ( vv. 16\u201323 ), Believers should exercise self-control, endure for the sake of the gospel, and run their race to obtain the eternal prize ( vv. 24\u201327 ). In Chapter 10, Paul warns the Corinthians against idolatry and overconfidence, using Israel's wilderness experiences as examples of disobedience and God's judgment ( vv. 1\u201311 ). He urges them to flee from idolatry and reminds them that they cannot partake of both the Lord\u2019s table and the table of demons ( vv. 14\u201322 ). Paul emphasizes that all actions should be done for God\u2019s glory and for the benefit of others, avoiding behavior that might cause others to stumble ( vv. 23\u201333 ). Christ is presented as the spiritual Rock who sustains His people ( v. 4 ), Believers should flee idolatry, seek God\u2019s glory in all things, and act with consideration for the conscience of others ( vv. 14, 31\u201332 ). In Chapter 11, Paul addresses issues of proper conduct in worship, emphasizing the importance of headship and orderly appearance during prayer and prophecy ( vv. 2\u201316 ). He also rebukes the Corinthians for their improper observance of the Lord\u2019s Supper , urging them to partake in a worthy manner, recognizing the body of Christ, and examining themselves to avoid judgment ( vv. 17\u201334 ). Christ is presented as the head of every believer and the one who instituted the Lord\u2019s Supper to proclaim His death until He comes ( vv. 3, 23\u201326 ), Believers should honor Christ\u2019s authority, participate in the Lord\u2019s Supper reverently, and examine themselves before partaking ( vv. 28\u201331 ). In Chapter 12, Paul explains the diversity of spiritual gifts and their unified purpose within the body of Christ, emphasizing that all gifts come from the same Spirit and are given for the common good ( vv. 4\u201311 ). He uses the analogy of the human body to illustrate how believers, though many, are one body in Christ, with each member essential to the whole ( vv. 12\u201327 ). Paul highlights the variety of roles in the church, such as apostles, prophets, and teachers, and encourages believers to earnestly desire the greater gifts, promising to show them a better way in Chapter 13 ( vv. 28\u201331 ). Christ is presented as the head of the body, uniting and empowering its members through the Spirit ( vv. 12\u201313 ), Believers should recognize the value of each member, use their gifts for the common good, and seek the greater gifts with love ( vv. 7, 25\u201331 ).

He describes love\u2019s attributes: it is patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude; it rejoices with the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things ( vv. 4\u20137 ). Paul emphasizes that love never ends, contrasting it with spiritual gifts like prophecy and tongues, which are temporary ( vv. 8\u201310 ). He concludes that faith, hope, and love remain, but the greatest of these is love ( v. 13 ). Christ is presented as the ultimate demonstration of perfect love ( v. 13 ), Believers should pursue love as the greatest virtue, reflecting Christ\u2019s character in all they do ( vv. 4\u20137 ). In Chapter 14, Paul emphasizes the importance of order and edification in corporate worship, contrasting the use of tongues and prophecy ( vv. 1\u201325 ). He teaches that prophecy builds up the church by encouraging, comforting, and instructing, while tongues, unless interpreted, benefit only the speaker ( vv. 3\u20135, 12 ). Paul sets guidelines for orderly worship, instructing that everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way to reflect God\u2019s character of peace, not confusion ( vv. 26\u201333, 40 ). Christ is presented as the head of the church, whose worship should reflect God\u2019s order and edification ( v. 33 ), Believers should pursue gifts that build up the church, speak intelligibly for edification, and ensure worship honors God\u2019s order and peace ( vv. 12, 26, 33, 40 ). In Chapter 15, Paul declares the resurrection of Christ as the cornerstone of the gospel and the assurance of believers\u2019 resurrection ( vv. 1\u201322 ). He explains the culmination of God\u2019s redemptive plan: Christ will reign until He has abolished all rule, authority, and power, putting all enemies under His feet, with the final enemy being death ( vv. 24\u201326 ). Christ will then hand over the kingdom to God the Father, completing His mission and ushering in the eternal reign of God, where sin and death are no more ( vv. 27\u201328 ). Paul also describes the resurrection body as imperishable and glorified, fit for the eternal kingdom ( vv. 35\u201353 ). Christ is presented as the reigning King who conquers all enemies, including death, and hands the kingdom to the Father ( vv. 24\u201326 ), Believers should stand firm in their hope, hold fast to the gospel, and labor faithfully for the Lord, knowing their work is not in vain ( vv. 2, 58 ).

He emphasizes that the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but the power of God to those being saved ( vs. 18 ), and highlights God\u2019s wisdom in choosing the foolish and weak to shame the wise and strong ( vs. 27-29 ). Christ is presented as the power and wisdom of God, who unites believers and sanctifies them ( vs. 24, 30 ). Believers should strive for unity in the church ( vs. 10 ), boast only in the Lord ( vs. 31 ), and live as those called to fellowship with Christ ( vs. 9 ). In Chapter 2, Paul explains that he came to the Corinthians not with eloquence or worldly wisdom, but proclaiming Jesus Christ and Him crucified ( vs. 1-5 ). He contrasts the wisdom of this age with the wisdom of God, revealed through the Spirit, and declares that \u201cthe natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him\u201d ( vs. 14 ). Christ is presented as the crucified Savior, through whom God\u2019s wisdom and mystery are revealed to believers ( vs. 7-8 ). Believers should rely on the Spirit for understanding ( vs. 10 ), avoid boasting in human wisdom, and embrace the mind of Christ ( vs. 16 ). In Chapter 3, Paul addresses the Corinthians' divisions and reminds them that believers are God\u2019s field and building, with Christ as the only foundation ( vs. 6-11 ). He warns that each one\u2019s works will be tested by fire: \u201cgold, silver, and precious stones\u201d will endure, but \u201cwood, hay, and straw\u201d will be burned up, revealing the quality of their labor ( vs. 12-15 ). Christ is presented as the foundation upon which all spiritual work must be built to have lasting, eternal value ( vs. 11 ). Believers should build wisely, recognizing that they are the temple of God where the Holy Spirit dwells ( vs. 16-17 ), and live in a way that reflects God\u2019s holiness. In Chapter 4, Paul emphasizes that apostles and ministers of Christ are stewards of the mysteries of God, and their primary responsibility is to be faithful ( vs. 1-2 ). He warns against judging prematurely, reminding the Corinthians that \u201ceach one\u2019s praise will come to him from God\u201d when the Lord returns ( vs. 5 ). Christ is presented as the Lord who will bring to light what is hidden and judge the hearts of all ( vs. 5 ). Believers should refrain from pride and boasting in human leaders ( vs. 6 ), imitate the humility of Christ\u2019s servants ( vs. 16 ), and live as faithful stewards accountable to God.","title":"II.

He emphasizes that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, urging the Corinthians to remove sin from their midst to be a new, unleavened batch, as Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed ( vs. 6-8 ). Christ is presented as the Passover Lamb whose sacrifice calls believers to holiness and purity ( vs. 7 ). Believers should mourn over sin, purge evil from among them ( vs. 2, 13 ), and live as a sanctified community in sincerity and truth ( vs. 8 ). In Chapter 6, Paul rebukes the Corinthians for settling disputes in secular courts and reminds them that believers, sanctified and justified in Christ, are called to judge with godly wisdom ( vv. 1\u20136, 11 ). He warns against sins like sexual immorality and idolatry, emphasizing that their bodies, as temples of the Holy Spirit, must glorify God, for they were bought with a price ( vv. 9\u201320 ). Christ is presented as the one who justifies and sanctifies believers through His name ( v. 11 ), Believers should flee from sexual immorality and glorify God in their bodies ( vv. 18\u201320 ).","title":"III.

He teaches that marriage is a safeguard against immorality, but those who are single can devote themselves more fully to the Lord ( vv. 2, 32\u201335 ). Paul allows for divorce only in specific cases and encourages believers to remain in their current circumstances, whether married, single, or enslaved, as they serve the Lord ( vv. 10\u201324 ). Christ is presented as the Lord who calls each believer to live faithfully in their assigned circumstances ( vv. 17, 24 ), Believers should honor God in their marital and personal relationships and remain faithful to the Lord\u2019s calling in their lives ( vv. 17, 35 ). In Chapter 8, Paul discusses the issue of eating food sacrificed to idols, emphasizing that while knowledge can lead to freedom, love should guide believers' actions to avoid causing others to stumble ( vv. 1\u20133, 9 ). He explains that idols have no real existence and that there is only one God, yet some believers with weaker consciences may still view such practices as sinful ( vv. 4\u20137 ). Paul urges the Corinthians to prioritize the spiritual well-being of others over their own rights, avoiding behavior that might lead a weaker brother or sister into sin ( vv. 9\u201313 ). Christ is presented as the one through whom all things exist and who strengthens believers to live in love ( v. 6 ), Believers should act in love, building up others and avoiding actions that harm their faith ( vv. 1, 9, 13 ). In Chapter 9, Paul defends his rights as an apostle, explaining that while he has the right to financial support, he willingly forgoes it to avoid hindering the gospel ( vv. 1\u201315 ). He emphasizes his commitment to preaching the gospel free of charge and becoming all things to all people to save some ( vv. 16\u201323 ). Paul likens the Christian life to a race, urging believers to exercise self-discipline and strive for an imperishable crown ( vv. 24\u201327 ). Christ is presented as the source of the gospel and the ultimate goal of faithful service ( vv. 16\u201323 ), Believers should exercise self-control, endure for the sake of the gospel, and run their race to obtain the eternal prize ( vv. 24\u201327 ). In Chapter 10, Paul warns the Corinthians against idolatry and overconfidence, using Israel's wilderness experiences as examples of disobedience and God's judgment ( vv. 1\u201311 ). He urges them to flee from idolatry and reminds them that they cannot partake of both the Lord\u2019s table and the table of demons ( vv. 14\u201322 ). Paul emphasizes that all actions should be done for God\u2019s glory and for the benefit of others, avoiding behavior that might cause others to stumble ( vv. 23\u201333 ).

The Preface 1:1-4 II. The Preparation of the Savior vs. 1:5-2:52 Luke Chapter 1 In Chapter 1, Luke recounts the angel Gabriel\u2019s announcements to Zechariah and Mary about the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively. Mary visits Elizabeth, and John is born, with Zechariah prophesying about God\u2019s salvation plan ( vs. 67-80 ). Christ is presented as \"Son of the Most High\" whose arrival fulfills God\u2019s covenant to David and Abraham ( vs. 32-33, 54-55 ). I believe with Zechariah, on the whole of his prophecy but my key verse is \u201cBlessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people\u201d ( vs. 68 ). Luke Chapter 2 In Chapter 2, Luke recounts the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, the shepherds\u2019 visitation, His presentation at the temple, and the account of His interaction with the teachers in Jerusalem as a boy. Christ is presented as \u201ca Savior, who is Christ the Lord\u201d ( vs. 11 ), proclaimed to the shepherds at His birth. I believe my key verse is, \u201cA Light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel\u201d ( vs. 32 ), spoken by Simeon. \"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.\u201d ( vs. 14 ), proclaimed by the heavenly host at His birth. The introduction of the Savior vs. 3:1-4:15 Luke Chapter 3 In Chapter 3, Luke describes the ministry of John the Baptist, who preaches repentance for the forgiveness of sins and baptizes Jesus. John declares the coming of one mightier than himself, and Jesus\u2019 baptism is marked by the descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. Christ is presented as \u201cMy beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased\u201d ( vs. 22 ), as declared by the Father at His baptism. I believe my key verse is, \u201cJohn answered and said to them all, \u2018As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire\u2019\u201d ( vs. 16 ). IV. The Ministry of the Savior 4:16-9:50 Luke Chapter 4 In Chapter 4, Luke records Jesus\u2019 temptation in the wilderness, His inaugural teaching in the synagogue of Nazareth, and the beginning of His healing and deliverance ministry in Capernaum. Jesus declares the fulfillment of Isaiah\u2019s prophecy, and rebukes Satan\u2019s temptations by quoting Scripture. Christ is presented as \"The fulfillment of Scripture\" ( vs. 21 ) I believe my key verse is, \u201c\u201cI must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.\u201d ( vs. 43*) because the main theme of the Bible is about Christ and His Kingdom. Luke Chapter 5 In Chapter 5, Jesus calls His first disciples, heals a leper, forgives and heals a paralytic, and calls Levi (Matthew) to follow Him. He demonstrates His power over sickness, sin, and the hearts of men. Christ is presented as \u201cthe Son of Man who has authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d ( vs. 24 ). Believers should listen and obey Him, saying, \u201cMaster, I will do as You say\u201d ( vs. 5 ), humbly acknowledge their sinfulness, \u201cGo away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!\u201d ( vs. 8 ), and respond to His call, \u201cFollow Me\u201d ( vs. 27 ). Luke Chapter 6 In Chapter 6, Jesus declares Himself Lord of the Sabbath, teaches the Beatitudes, and calls His followers to love their enemies, judge not, and bear good fruit. He also heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, confronting the Pharisees. Christ is presented as \u201cthe Son of Man [who] is Lord of the Sabbath\u201d ( vs. 5 ). I rejoice and trust in, \u201cBlessed are you when people hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you\u2026 Rejoice on that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven\u201d ( vs. 22-23 ), looking forward to when He says to me, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant\u201d ( Matthew 25:21 ). Luke Chapter 7 In Chapter 7, Jesus heals the centurion\u2019s servant, raises a widow\u2019s son from the dead, and commends John the Baptist\u2019s ministry. He forgives the sins of a woman who anoints His feet with perfume, declaring her faith has saved her. Christ is presented as \u201ca great prophet\u201d ( vs. 16 ) and \"The Expected One\" ( vs. 19, Isaiah 35:5-6, Isaiah 61:1 ). Believers should consider themselves unworthy, as the centurion did when he said, \u201cI am not worthy for You to come under my roof\u201d ( vs. 6 ). \u201cBut a man must examine himself,\u201d ( 1 Corinthians 11:28 ). Luke Chapter 8 In Chapter 8, Jesus teaching in parables, calming a storm, casting out demons from a man in the Gerasenes, healing a woman with a hemorrhage, and raising Jairus\u2019 daughter from the dead. Despite Jesus saying, \u201cLet us go over to the other side\u201d ( vs. 22 ), the disciples\u2019 fear during the storm reveals their struggle to fully trust in His word. Christ is presented as \u201cthe one whom even the wind and the waves obey\u201d ( vs. 25 ), demonstrating His sovereign authority over creation and life. I want to be that guy, who, after being healed, obeyed Jesus\u2019 command to \u201cReturn to your house and describe what great things God has done for you\u201d ( vs. 39 ), sharing his testimony with the entire city. Luke Chapter 9 In Chapter 9, Luke describes Jesus sending out the twelve, feeding the five thousand, revealing His glory during the transfiguration, and teaching about the cost of discipleship. Jesus predicts His suffering, death, and resurrection. Christ is presented as \u201cThe Christ of God\u201d ( vs. 20 ), the anointed King foretold in Psalm 2:2-7 , and the ruler born in Bethlehem, \u201cwhose times of coming forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity\u201d ( Micah 5:2 ). Believers should trust in Him to provide for all their needs ( vs. 16 ), observing how this miracle was distributed: each disciple returned to Jesus to refill their baskets, a reminder that provision comes continually from Him. V. The Mission of the Savior vs. 9:51-18:30 Luke Chapter 10 In Chapter 10, Jesus sends out seventy disciples to proclaim the kingdom of God, teaching about loving one\u2019s neighbor through the parable of the Good Samaritan, and commending Mary for choosing to sit and listen at His feet, reminding His followers that true joy should come from their names being written in heaven ( vs. 20 ). Christ is presented as \u201cthe Lord of the harvest\u201d ( vs. 2 ), who sends workers to bring in the spiritual harvest. Believers should obey His call to \u201cGo!\u201d ( vs. 3 ), because \u201cThe harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few\u201d ( vs. 2 ), serve others with sacrificial love ( vs. 33-37 ), and prioritize time being in His presence ( vs. 41-42 ). Luke Chapter 11 In Chapter 11, Jesus teaches His disciples to pray, using what is known as the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and emphasizes persistence in prayer. He rebukes the Pharisees and lawyers for their hypocrisy and warns against seeking signs instead of responding to His teaching. Christ is presented as \u201cone greater than Jonah and Solomon\u201d ( vs. 31-32 ), calling people to repentance and wisdom. Believers should persist in prayer, as Jesus said, \u201cAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you\u201d ( vs. 9 ), and live authentically, avoiding hypocrisy ( vs. 39-52 ). Luke Chapter 12 In Chapter 12, Jesus warns His disciples against hypocrisy, greed, and anxiety, urging them to seek God\u2019s kingdom first. He tells the parable of the rich fool, teaches about trusting God\u2019s provision, and calls for readiness for His return. Christ is presented as the one who comes to bring division ( vs. 51 ) and the one who \u201ccasts fire upon the earth\u201d (a reference to the Holy Spirit, Acts 1:8 ). Believers should \u201cnot be afraid, little flock, because your Father has chosen to give you the kingdom\u201d ( vs. 32 ) and \u201cbe ready; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think\u201d ( vs. 40 ). Luke Chapter 13 In Chapter 13, Jesus teaches about repentance using the examples of the Galileans and the fallen tower of Siloam, tells the parable of the barren fig tree, and heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath. He warns of the narrow door to salvation ( vs. 24 ) and laments over Jerusalem\u2019s rejection of Him. Christ is presented as the rejected Messiah of Israel: \u201cBehold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until you say, \u2018Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019\u201d ( vs. 35 ). Believers should repent without delay ( vs. 3 ), bear fruit in their lives ( vs. 6-9 ), and \u201cstrive to enter the narrow door\u201d by following Jesus faithfully ( vs. 24 ). Luke Chapter 14 In Chapter 14, Jesus heals a man with dropsy on the Sabbath, teaches about humility through the parable of the wedding feast, and challenges His followers to count the cost of discipleship. He emphasizes the need for full commitment ( vs. 27 ) and tells the parable of the great banquet, where the invited guests, symbolizing Israel, reject the invitation. Christ is presented as the Messiah to the Gentiles, calling them from \u201cthe roads and the hedges\u201d to fill His house ( vs. 23-24 ). Believers should heed His words: \u201cIf anyone comes to Me and hates even his own life, he cannot be My disciple. Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple\u201d ( vs. 26-27 ). Luke Chapter 15 In Chapter 15, Jesus tells three parables: the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son, illustrating God\u2019s joy over the repentance of sinners. He emphasizes the love and mercy of the Father, who welcomes back the repentant with open arms. Christ is presented as the Good Shepherd who seeks the lost and rejoices over their return ( vs. 4-7 ). Believers should reflect the Father\u2019s heart by forgiving others and celebrating their repentance, just as the father said, \u201cThis brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found\u201d ( vs. 32 ). Luke Chapter 16 In Chapter 16, Jesus teaches about stewardship through the parable of the dishonest manager and warns against the love of money. He tells the story of the rich man and Lazarus, showing the eternal consequences of ignoring God\u2019s commands and neglecting others. Christ is presented as the one who reveals the sufficiency of God\u2019s Word, saying, \u201cIf they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead\u201d ( vs. 31 ). Believers should live with eternal priorities, being faithful stewards of what God has entrusted, and heed the Word of God as their guide for repentance and salvation ( vs. 10-13, 31 ). Luke Chapter 17 In Chapter 17, Jesus teaches His disciples about forgiveness, faith, and gratitude, warning against causing others to stumble. He cleanses ten lepers, but only one returns to give thanks, and He speaks of the coming of the kingdom of God, saying, \u201cThe kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed\u201d ( vs. 20 ). Christ is presented as the King who reveals the presence of God\u2019s kingdom among His people ( vs. 21 ). Believers should forgive others repeatedly ( vs. 4 ), live with a thankful heart ( vs. 15-18 ), and remain vigilant, for \u201cthe Son of Man will be revealed\u201d in His time ( vs. 30 ). Luke Chapter 18 In Chapter 18, Jesus teaches on persistent prayer through the parable of the persistent widow, contrasts humility and pride in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, and welcomes children, saying, \u201cWhoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all\u201d ( vs. 17 ). He also challenges a rich young ruler about the cost of following Him and foretells His death and resurrection. Christ is presented as the Son of Man who will be mocked, mistreated, killed, and rise on the third day ( vs. 31-33 ). Believers should pray persistently and not lose heart ( vs. 1 ), humble themselves before God ( vs. 14 ), and follow Jesus with childlike faith and trust ( vs. 17 ). VI. The Passion of the Savior vs. 18:31 - 23:56 Luke Chapter 19 In Chapter 19, Jesus visits Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector who repents and is restored, teaches the parable of the minas to illustrate stewardship and accountability, and enters Jerusalem triumphantly, being praised as the King who comes in the name of the Lord. He weeps over Jerusalem, lamenting their failure to recognize the time of their visitation. Christ is presented as the King who brings salvation, saying, \u201cThe Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost\u201d ( vs. 10 ). Believers should receive Jesus joyfully, like Zacchaeus ( vs. 6 ), steward their lives for God\u2019s glory ( vs. 13 ), and proclaim Him as King, rejoicing that \u201cBlessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d ( vs. 38 ). Luke Chapter 20 In Chapter 20, Jesus confronts the religious leaders with parables and teachings, exposes their hypocrisy, and challenges their understanding of the Messiah by asking, \u201cHow is it that they say the Christ is David\u2019s son?\u201d ( vs. 41 ). Quoting Psalm 110:1, He reveals that the Christ is not only David\u2019s descendant but also his Lord, emphasizing His divine nature. Christ is presented as the eternal Lord who fulfills both the Davidic covenant and divine sovereignty ( vs. 42-44 ). Believers should recognize Jesus as both Lord and Messiah, avoiding the hypocrisy of the scribes, and love God with all their heart, soul, and mind ( vs. 46-47 ). Luke Chapter 21 In Chapter 21, Jesus teaches about the end times, warning of signs such as wars, earthquakes, and persecution, while encouraging His followers to stand firm in their faith. He speaks of the destruction of the temple, saying, \u201cNot one stone will be left upon another\u201d ( vs. 6 ), and assures them of His return in glory, commanding, \u201cStraighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near\u201d ( vs. 28 ). Christ is presented as the sovereign King who will return in power and great glory to establish His kingdom ( vs. 27 ). Believers should remain watchful and pray, as Jesus said, \u201cKeep watch at all times, praying that you will have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man\u201d ( vs. 36 ). Luke Chapter 22 In Chapter 22, Jesus celebrates the Last Supper with His disciples, institutes the Lord\u2019s Supper, and predicts Peter\u2019s denial. He prays in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, saying, \u201cFather, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done\u201d ( vs. 42 ), before being betrayed by Judas and arrested. Christ is presented as the suffering Servant who submits to the will of the Father, even in the face of betrayal and death ( vs. 42 ). Believers should remember His sacrifice, as He commanded, \u201cDo this in remembrance of Me\u201d ( vs. 19 ), and pray for strength to resist temptation, as Jesus urged, \u201cPray that you do not come into temptation\u201d ( vs. 40 ). Luke Chapter 23 In Chapter 23, Jesus is tried before Pilate and Herod, sentenced to crucifixion, and dies on the cross, bearing the sins of the world. On the cross, He prays, \u201cFather, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing\u201d ( vs. 34 ), and promises the repentant thief, \u201cTruly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise\u201d ( vs. 43 ). Christ is presented as the King of the Jews who willingly lays down His life for sinners ( vs. 3, 38 ). Believers should reflect on His forgiveness and mercy, trusting in His promise of eternal life, as demonstrated in His words to the repentant thief ( vs. 43 ). VII. The Resurrection of the Savior vs. 24:1 - 51 Luke Chapter 24 In Chapter 24, Jesus rises from the dead, appears to two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and later reveals Himself to the eleven, explaining how the Scriptures foretold His suffering and resurrection. He commissions His disciples to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name to all nations and ascends into heaven. Christ is presented as the risen Savior who fulfills the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms ( vs. 44 ), and brings salvation to the world. Believers should rejoice in His resurrection and obey His command to be witnesses, as He said, \u201cYou are witnesses of these things\u201d ( vs. 48 ).","title":"NTSurvey - Gospel of Luke"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyLuke/#diary-requirements","text":"Four chapters or less do one paragraph for entire letter Simplicity is key - one paragraph per chapter","title":"Diary requirements"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyLuke/#format-for-diary","text":"In Chapter __ Jesus (or the author) said, or did...

Resurrection of the Servant ( vs. 16:1-20 ) Part One: The Presentation of the Servant (1:1 - 2:12) Mark 1 In Chapter 1, Mark declares Jesus as the Son of God, affirmed by the Father at His baptism and through His proclamation of the gospel. Jesus begins His ministry, calls His first disciples, and performs miracles such as casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing a leper. Christ is presented as the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies by demonstrating His power to restore and heal. Believers should \"repent and believe in the gospel\" (vs. 15) and \"Follow Me, and become fishers of men\" (vs. 17), proclaiming the good news that the Kingdom of God is at hand. II. The Opening Ministry: Credentials Mark 2 In Chapter 2, Mark shows Jesus forgiving the sins of a paralytic, calling Levi (Matthew), and healing on the Sabbath, which leads to accusations from the Pharisees. Jesus also describes Himself as the Bridegroom, whose presence brings joy and renewal. Christ is presented as the Lord of the Sabbath, bringing rest from sin and restoring life to those who follow Him. Believers should rejoice in the new covenant relationship with the Bridegroom and enter Sabbath rest, through Jesus who forgives our sins. Here\u2019s the completed Mark 3 summary, continuing in the style you provided: Mark 3 In Chapter 3, Mark describes Jesus healing on the Sabbath, appointing twelve apostles, and teaching in parables after being rejected by the Pharisees and scribes. This generation of Israel commits the unforgivable sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah and attributing His works to Satan. Christ is presented as the Son of God, the one who redefines true family as those who do the will of God (vs. 35) .

Christ is presented as the King of David, the Root of Jesse ( Isaiah 11:1 ), and the Lion of Judah ( Genesis 49:9-10 ). Believers should be convicted to examine the Scriptures daily ( Acts 17:11 ) and be enlightened by the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus\u2019 genealogy (vs. 1-17).

Christ is presented as the King of the Jews, whose birth was divinely guided and protected despite worldly opposition. Believers should see how God fulfills His promises ( Numbers 23:19 ) and trust in His providence through trials ( Psalm 34:19 ). They should seek Christ and honor Him as the King (vs. 11). Matthew Chapter 3 In Chapter 3, Matthew introduces John the Baptist, who prepares the way of the Lord by calling people to repentance and baptizing them in the Jordan River. Jesus is baptized, and the heavens open, with the Spirit descending like a dove and the Father declaring, \u201cThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased\u201d (vs. 17). Christ is presented as the beloved Son, who identifies with humanity through His baptism and begins His public ministry. Believers should repent of their sins, as John proclaimed (vs. 2), and follow Jesus\u2019 example by publicly committing their lives to God through baptism (vs. 13-15). Matthew Chapter 4 In Chapter 4, Jesus is tempted by Satan in the wilderness, calls His first disciples, and begins His public ministry, preaching, \u201cRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (vs. 17).

Christ is presented as the victorious Redeemer, who overcame temptation and brought light to a people in darkness ( Isaiah 9:1-2 ). Believers should resist temptation by standing on God\u2019s Word (vs. 4, 7, 10), repent as Jesus preached (vs. 17), and follow Him wholeheartedly, leaving behind anything that hinders their calling (vs. 19-22). Section II: Principles Announced Chapters 4:12 - 7:29 Matthew Chapter 5 In Chapter 5, Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount, beginning with the Beatitudes and teaching about the law, anger, adultery, divorce, oaths, and loving one\u2019s enemies.

Believers should strive for a heart aligned with God\u2019s will, embracing humility, mercy, and purity (vs. 3-10), and demonstrate love even to their enemies as Jesus commanded (vs. 44). Matthew Chapter 6 In Chapter 6, Jesus continues the Sermon on the Mount, teaching about giving, prayer, fasting, and trusting God for provision. He introduces the Lord\u2019s Prayer as a model for communion with God (vs. 9-13) and warns against materialism, saying, \u201cSeek first His kingdom and His righteousness\u201d (vs. 33). Christ is presented as the one who reveals how to live a life pleasing to God through faith and devotion. Believers should give in secret (vs. 4), pray with sincerity (vs. 6), fast with humility (vs. 18), and trust God for their needs (vs. 25-34). Matthew Chapter 7 In Chapter 7, Jesus concludes the Sermon on the Mount by teaching about judging others, prayer, and the way to life, and ends with the parable of the wise and foolish builders. He warns about false prophets and emphasizes the necessity of doing the will of the Father to enter the kingdom of heaven (vs. 21). Christ is presented as the Judge and Guide to the narrow way, calling people to build their lives on His teachings. Believers should live with discernment (vs. 15-20), persist in prayer (vs. 7-8), and obey His words to build a firm foundation (vs. 24-27). Section III: The Power Revealed Chapters 8:1 - 11:1 Matthew Chapter 8 In Chapter 8, Jesus performs several miracles, including healing a leper (vs. 2-3), calming a storm (vs. 26), and casting out demons (vs. 32). He also emphasizes the cost of following Him (vs. 22). Christ is presented as the compassionate Healer and the one with power over nature, sickness, and the spiritual realm. Believers should have faith in Jesus\u2019 power to save (vs. 10, 26) and follow Him wholeheartedly, regardless of personal cost (vs. 19-22). Matthew Chapter 9 In Chapter 9, Jesus forgives and heals a paralytic (vs. 2-7), calls Matthew to follow Him (vs. 9), and raises a dead girl while healing others. He also teaches about fasting (vs. 37). Christ is presented as the one who has the authority to forgive sins and calls sinners to repentance. Believers should trust Jesus for physical and spiritual healing (vs. 2), respond to His call to follow Him (vs. 9), and actively join the workers in bringing in the harvest, praying for more laborers (vs. 37-38). Matthew Chapter 10 In Chapter 10, Jesus sends out the twelve apostles with authority to heal and cast out demons, instructing them to proclaim, \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (vs. 7). He warns them of persecution (vs. 22), but also encourages them, (vs. 28). Christ is presented as the sender of workers into the harvest and the one who strengthens His followers in the face of persecution. Believers should proclaim the good news fearlessly (vs. 7, 28), endure opposition (vs. 22), and prioritize their loyalty to Jesus above all else (vs. 37-39). Section IV: The Program Explained Chapters 11:2 - 13:53 Chapter 11 In Chapter 11, Jesus reassures John the Baptist that He is indeed the Messiah by pointing to His miraculous works. He condemns unrepentant cities for rejecting His message and invites those burdened and weary to find rest in Him, showing both judgment and compassion. Christ was presented as the \u201cExpected One,\u201d fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. Believers should recognize Jesus as the promised fulfillment of Old Testament Scripture and take seriously the consequences of those who reject His message, as demonstrated by His warnings to the unrepentant cities. Chapter 12 In Chapter 12, Jesus faces intensified rejection from the Pharisees, who accuse Him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul. He warns them of the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, a sin rooted in Israel's national rejection of Him as the Christ. Jesus marks this as a pivotal moment, shifting to parables as He continues to confront unbelief. Christ was presented as the rejected Messiah, whose authority and identity were challenged by the religious leaders. Believers should rejoice in the significance of this chapter, understanding Israel's rejection of the Messiah and the Kingdom, and be thankful that the offer of the Kingdom is now extended to the Gentiles, embracing the generous, free gift of grace. Chapter 13 In Chapter 13, Jesus uses parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, unveiling hidden truths and distinguishing genuine seekers from the hard-hearted. This separation reflects God\u2019s sovereign grace, as the gospel is revealed to the humble and concealed from the proud. Christ is presented as the Pearl of Great Price, whose worth surpasses all else. Believers should recognize the immense value of the Kingdom and the great sacrifice Christ made, responding with gratitude and whole-hearted devotion as bondservants of Christ. Section V: The Purpose Declared Chapters 13:54 - 19:2 Chapter 14 In Chapter 14, Jesus feeds the 5,000, the first miracle recorded in all four Gospels, demonstrating His ability to provide abundantly when the disciples bring their limited resources to Him. He also walks on water, testing His disciples' faith and demonstrating His divinity over creation. Christ is presented as the Messiah, the compassionate provider who meets the needs of the multitude, and the Sovereign Lord over creation. Believers should learn to bring their needs and inadequacies to Jesus, trusting in His power to provide and understanding that true faith means continually depending on Him, even in life\u2019s storms. Chapter 15 In Chapter 15, Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for elevating human traditions above God\u2019s commandments, emphasizing the need for inward purity. He honors the persistent faith of a Gentile woman and miraculously feeds 4,000 people, showing that His mission extends beyond Israel to include all who believe. Christ was presented as the compassionate Savior who honors genuine faith, even to the Gentiles. Believers should praise God for His grace that extends beyond the boundaries of Israel, He has not forgotten those who once did not know Him and that His mercy reaches all who come to Him in faith. Chapter 16 In Chapter 16, Jesus is tested by the Pharisees and Sadducees, who demand a sign, but He points to the sign of Jonah as a foreshadowing of His resurrection. Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ, and Jesus begins to teach about His impending suffering, instructing His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him, illustrating the cost of true discipleship. Christ is presented as the Messiah, affirmed by Peter\u2019s declaration, \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d Believers should \u201cdeny themselves and take up their cross,\u201d emphasizing the cost of true discipleship, and they are warned to guard against the spiritual corruption of false teachers. Chapter 17 In Chapter 17, Matthew describes the Transfiguration, where Jesus\u2019 divine glory is revealed to Peter, James, and John. Moses and Elijah appear, and God affirms Jesus as His beloved Son. Later, Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy whom the disciples could not cure, emphasizing the necessity of faith. Christ is presented as the majestic and glorious King, who reigns with divine authority over all creation. Believers should recognize this moment as a powerful confirmation of Jesus' true identity and honor Him as the Sovereign King who fulfills God\u2019s redemptive plan. Chapter 18 In Chapter 18, Jesus teaches about the importance of humility and caring for \"little ones,\" warning against causing others to stumble. He shares the Parable of the Lost Sheep, emphasizes reconciliation within the church, and illustrates the necessity of forgiveness through the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant. Christ is presented as the compassionate and protective Shepherd, who values every individual and seeks to bring the lost back into His fold. Believers should embody childlike humility, take sin seriously, seek to reconcile broken relationships, and forgive others from the heart, just as God has forgiven them. Section VI: The Problems Presented Chapters 19:3 - 26:2 Chapter 19 In Chapter 19, Matthew depicts the testing of Jesus by the Pharisees on the issue of divorce, mirroring the examination of the Passover lamb for blemishes. Jesus also blesses the children and teaches about the difficulty of a rich person entering the Kingdom, emphasizing humility and the eternal rewards awaiting those who follow Him. Christ is presented as the spotless Lamb, whose perfection endures every test by human intellect and religious scrutiny. Believers should embrace humility, serve with selflessness, and understand that the path to greatness in God\u2019s Kingdom is marked by a childlike faith and a heart devoted to service. Chapter 20 In Chapter 20, Jesus teaches the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard, He then predicts His suffering, death, and resurrection for the third time and subtly alludes to the future of James and John, with James becoming the first martyr and John living the longest. Jesus emphasizes servant leadership. He also heals two blind men who call out to Him as the \u201cSon of David,\u201d demonstrating His compassion and Messianic authority. Christ is presented as the humble and sacrificial servant. Believers should strive to serve others selflessly in all humility and have eyes for eternal things, knowing our rewards will be great if we do the works God has planned beforehand, \u201cFor we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\u201d (Ephesians 2:10) Crowd misinterpretation explained The people of Jerusalem misinterpreted the nature of Jesus' kingship during His Triumphal Entry. They saw Him as a political and national deliverer, a humble yet victorious King who would overthrow their Roman oppressors and restore Israel to its former glory. However, they failed to grasp that He was first coming as the suffering servant foretold in Isaiah 53 \u2014the one who would bear the sins of His people, be crushed and beaten on their behalf, and bring about atonement for sin. The Deeper Spiritual Reality of Jesus' Entry While the crowd celebrated Jesus' arrival as a King and Judge, waving branches in hopes of imminent deliverance, they missed the crucial reality that He had come to offer Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Without this atonement\u2014His death on the cross to bear the punishment for sin\u2014there would be no basis for anyone to stand before God. Indeed, without His sacrificial work, every human being would be judged and found guilty before God, even before they were born. Chapter 21 In Chapter 21, Jesus enters Jerusalem triumphantly on a foal of a donkey, with people laying down their coats and spreading branches, symbolizing joy and anticipation of a victorious, humble King and Judge. The crowd misunderstood His mission, expecting immediate deliverance and judgment rather than recognizing Him as the suffering servant who would first be crushed for their sins. Jesus cleanses the temple, declaring it a house of prayer, and curses a barren fig tree, a symbolic act against fruitless religion. He teaches the Parable of the Vineyard, exposing Israel\u2019s religious leaders and foreshadowing God\u2019s judgment on their unfaithfulness. Christ is presented as the misunderstood Messiah, heralded as a King but ultimately coming to fulfill the role of the suffering servant, who would atone for the sins of His people before returning as Judge. Believers should reflect on the necessity of Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice and be thankful for His first coming as a Savior, understanding that without His work on the cross, we would face judgment without hope. Chapter 22 In Chapter 22, Jesus tells the Parable of the Wedding Feast, where the originally invited guests\u2014representing Israel\u2014refuse to come and even kill the King\u2019s servants. In response, the King destroys their city, a prophetic reference to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., and then extends the invitation to the Gentiles, clothing them in His righteousness. Those who come to the feast without proper wedding attire are cast out, illustrating the necessity of being clothed in Christ\u2019s righteousness rather than relying on self-righteousness. The religious leaders continue to test Jesus, but His answers reveal His divine wisdom and authority. Christ is presented as the sovereign King who, after being rejected by Israel, extends His gracious invitation to the Gentiles. Believers should understand that when they put their complete faith and trust in Christ, they are clothed with His righteousness and will one day participate in a magnificent feast prepared by the King of Kings. This truth calls for humility, gratitude, and a life devoted to honoring the gracious invitation of God. Chapter 23 In Chapter 23, Jesus delivers a scathing denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, pronouncing a series of woes upon them for their hypocrisy and spiritual blindness. He condemns their actions, such as placing heavy burdens on others while neglecting the weightier matters of the law like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Jesus mourns over Jerusalem, lamenting its rejection of God\u2019s messengers and foreshadowing the coming judgment for their unbelief. Christ is presented as the righteous Judge who exposes religious hypocrisy and the compassionate Savior who grieves over the lost. Believers should examine their own hearts for hypocrisy, strive to practice genuine faith marked by justice, mercy, and humility, and be moved by Christ\u2019s compassion for the lost, praying for and seeking their salvation. Chapter 24 In Chapter 24, Jesus delivers the Olivet Discourse, a prophetic message about the end times, including the destruction of the temple, signs of His coming, and the end of the age. He describes events such as wars, famines, earthquakes, and great tribulation, warning His disciples to stay alert and not be deceived by false messiahs. Jesus emphasizes the suddenness of His return, likening it to a thief in the night, and urges His followers to be watchful and faithful, as no one knows the day or the hour. Christ is presented as the prophetic Son of Man who will return in glory to judge the living and the dead. Believers should remain spiritually alert, discerning the signs of the times, and live faithfully in anticipation of Christ\u2019s return, knowing that their hope is in His promised coming and the establishment of His Kingdom. Chapter 25 In Chapter 25, Jesus continues the Olivet Discourse with three parables that emphasize the necessity of being prepared for His return and living faithfully in the present. The Parable of the Ten Virgins illustrates the importance of spiritual readiness, as only the wise virgins who kept their lamps filled with oil were prepared to meet the Bridegroom. The Parable of the Talents teaches that believers must use the gifts and responsibilities entrusted to them, as the faithful servants were rewarded, while the one who buried his talent was cast out. Finally, the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats describes the final judgment, where Christ separates people based on their actions, with the righteous entering eternal life and the unrighteous facing eternal punishment. Christ is presented as the Bridegroom who comes unexpectedly, the Master who entrusts His servants with responsibilities, and the King who judges the nations. Believers should be vigilant, actively use their God-given resources to serve Him, and demonstrate genuine faith through acts of love and compassion, knowing that their lives will be judged by how they have honored Christ. Section VII: The Passion Accomplished Chapters 26:3 - 28:10 Chapter 26 In Chapter 26, Jesus prepares for His crucifixion, predicting His imminent betrayal and instituting the Last Supper, where He shares bread and wine as symbols of His body and blood given for the forgiveness of sins. Judas agrees to betray Jesus, and later, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prays in deep anguish, submitting to the Father's will. He is arrested and taken before the high priest, where He is falsely accused, mocked, and condemned, while Peter denies knowing Him three times, fulfilling Jesus\u2019 earlier prediction. Christ is presented as the sacrificial Lamb who willingly submits to God\u2019s redemptive plan, and the suffering Savior who experiences betrayal, sorrow, and rejection. Believers should reflect on Christ's sacrifice, understanding the depth of His love and commitment, and be steadfast in faith, even when facing trials and temptations. Chapter 27 In Chapter 27, Jesus is brought before Pilate, who reluctantly sentences Him to be crucified, despite finding no guilt in Him, as the crowd demands His death. Jesus is mocked, beaten, and crowned with thorns by Roman soldiers before being led to Golgotha, where He is crucified alongside two criminals. At His death, darkness covers the land, the temple veil is torn in two, and the earth quakes, signifying the profound spiritual significance of His sacrifice. Joseph of Arimathea then places Jesus' body in a tomb, and the religious leaders secure it with a guard, fearing His resurrection. Christ is presented as the suffering and sacrificial Savior, the King of the Jews who endures mockery and crucifixion to fulfill God\u2019s redemptive plan. Believers should stand in awe of the depth of Jesus\u2019 sacrifice, understanding that His death was the payment for sin and the fulfillment of prophecy, and trust in the power of His atoning work. Chapter 28 In Chapter 28, Jesus rises from the dead, and the women who come to the tomb are greeted by an angel who announces His resurrection. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, instructing them to tell His disciples to meet Him in Galilee. Later, Jesus meets with His disciples and gives them the Great Commission, commanding them to \u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.\u201d He promises to be with them always, even to the end of the age. Christ is presented as the risen Lord, victorious over death, and the sovereign King who commissions His followers to spread the gospel. Believers should rejoice in the hope of the resurrection, embrace their mission to make disciples of all nations, and live confidently in the presence and authority of the risen Christ. Epilogue: The Great Commission Chapters 28:11 - 20 In this final section, Matthew describes how the guards at Jesus\u2019 tomb are bribed by the chief priests to spread a false report that His disciples stole His body. Meanwhile, Jesus meets His disciples in Galilee and delivers the Great Commission, instructing them to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey all He has commanded. He assures them of His presence, saying, \u201cAnd behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\u201d Christ is presented as the risen and authoritative Lord who commands and empowers His followers to continue His mission. Believers should take the Great Commission seriously, spreading the gospel and making disciples, confident in the enduring presence and authority of Jesus.","title":"NTSurvey - Gospel of Matthew"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyMatthew/#diary-requirements","text":"Four chapters or less do one paragraph for entire letter Simplicity is key - one paragraph per chapter","title":"Diary requirements"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyMatthew/#format-for-diary","text":"In Chapter __ Jesus (or the author) said, or did...

Christ is presented as the Bridegroom who comes unexpectedly, the Master who entrusts His servants with responsibilities, and the King who judges the nations. Believers should be vigilant, actively use their God-given resources to serve Him, and demonstrate genuine faith through acts of love and compassion, knowing that their lives will be judged by how they have honored Christ.","title":"The Deeper Spiritual Reality of Jesus' Entry"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyMatthew/#section-vii-the-passion-accomplished","text":"Chapters 26:3 - 28:10 Chapter 26 In Chapter 26, Jesus prepares for His crucifixion, predicting His imminent betrayal and instituting the Last Supper, where He shares bread and wine as symbols of His body and blood given for the forgiveness of sins. Judas agrees to betray Jesus, and later, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prays in deep anguish, submitting to the Father's will. He is arrested and taken before the high priest, where He is falsely accused, mocked, and condemned, while Peter denies knowing Him three times, fulfilling Jesus\u2019 earlier prediction. Christ is presented as the sacrificial Lamb who willingly submits to God\u2019s redemptive plan, and the suffering Savior who experiences betrayal, sorrow, and rejection. Believers should reflect on Christ's sacrifice, understanding the depth of His love and commitment, and be steadfast in faith, even when facing trials and temptations. Chapter 27 In Chapter 27, Jesus is brought before Pilate, who reluctantly sentences Him to be crucified, despite finding no guilt in Him, as the crowd demands His death. Jesus is mocked, beaten, and crowned with thorns by Roman soldiers before being led to Golgotha, where He is crucified alongside two criminals. At His death, darkness covers the land, the temple veil is torn in two, and the earth quakes, signifying the profound spiritual significance of His sacrifice. Joseph of Arimathea then places Jesus' body in a tomb, and the religious leaders secure it with a guard, fearing His resurrection. Christ is presented as the suffering and sacrificial Savior, the King of the Jews who endures mockery and crucifixion to fulfill God\u2019s redemptive plan. Believers should stand in awe of the depth of Jesus\u2019 sacrifice, understanding that His death was the payment for sin and the fulfillment of prophecy, and trust in the power of His atoning work. Chapter 28 In Chapter 28, Jesus rises from the dead, and the women who come to the tomb are greeted by an angel who announces His resurrection. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, instructing them to tell His disciples to meet Him in Galilee. Later, Jesus meets with His disciples and gives them the Great Commission, commanding them to \u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.\u201d He promises to be with them always, even to the end of the age. Christ is presented as the risen Lord, victorious over death, and the sovereign King who commissions His followers to spread the gospel. Believers should rejoice in the hope of the resurrection, embrace their mission to make disciples of all nations, and live confidently in the presence and authority of the risen Christ.","title":"Section VII: The Passion Accomplished"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyMatthew/#epilogue-the-great-commission","text":"Chapters 28:11 - 20 In this final section, Matthew describes how the guards at Jesus\u2019 tomb are bribed by the chief priests to spread a false report that His disciples stole His body.

He assures them of His presence, saying, \u201cAnd behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\u201d Christ is presented as the risen and authoritative Lord who commands and empowers His followers to continue His mission.

This story is not mentioned anywhere else in the gospel and seems obvious that the writer John Mark was the young man. Acts 12:12ff And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. Common meeting place apparently she was well to do. John Mark probably grew up in a home with a God fearing mother Col 4:10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas\u2019s cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); Mark was well known in the Church community with a home church and Barnabas's cousin, Paul had high regards for him, and he was a friend of Peter Philemon 24 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 24as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers. To be mentioned in a list from Paul by name and your name recorded in the Bible. A humble honor Acts 13:5 & 15:37-39 When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper. Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. 38But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. 39And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. Then to be rebuked by Paul, because he was lazy? 2 Tim. 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. Interesting that Mark is now useful to Paul at this time, back in Acts he was not 1 Pet 5:13 *She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. * Peter considers Mark his son in the faith Acts 13:13 Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem. John Mark was a helper in 8 verses before, now he is going back to Jerusalem, so 2 chapters later, Paul must have rebuked Mark about going back to Jerusalem. He probably missed his mother, it sounds like this may have been his first mission trip? How would you describe Mark\u2019s character having read Mark 14:51, Acts 12:12ff, Col.4:10 & Philemon 24, Acts 13:5 & 15:37\u201339, 2 Tim. 4:11, 1 Peter 5:13, Acts 13:3? \"Initially marked by fear and unreliability, he matures into a faithful and valued servant of Christ. His story demonstrates the importance of mentorship (from Barnabas and Peter). Mark\u2019s eventual role as the author of the Gospel of Mark highlights God\u2019s ability to use imperfect people for His purposes.\" Read Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels pp. 36-37, 50-51, 95-96 . 1. What kinds of connections are there between Matthew, Mark and Luke when they cover the same material? \"The Synoptic Gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark, and Luke\u2014share significant material, including major events like Jesus\u2019 baptism, miracles, teachings, and the Passion narrative. They often follow a similar chronological flow, emphasizing themes such as the proclamation of God\u2019s kingdom and Jesus\u2019 role as Messiah. Many passages appear in all three Gospels with parallel wording and structure, likely reflecting shared sources like Mark or the hypothetical \"Q\" document. This commonality provides a cohesive narrative of Jesus\u2019 ministry while retaining unique nuances.\" What are some of the differences between them? \"Despite their connections, the Gospels differ in emphasis, audience focus, and narrative details.

MATTHEW What was Matthew\u2019s relationship to Jesus? Matthew, also known as Levi, was one of Jesus' twelve apostles and a former tax collector. Matthew wrote from Antioch about what year? Matthew likely wrote his gospel around 70\u201385 AD from Antioch. What was Matthew\u2019s main concern as he wrote? Matthew\u2019s main concern was to present Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and as the Messiah, emphasizing His role in the Kingdom of Heaven. Matthew wrote his gospel primarily for whom? Matthew wrote primarily for a Jewish audience. MARK What was Mark\u2019s relationship to Jesus? Mark, also known as John Mark, was not one of the twelve apostles but was a close associate of the apostles, particularly Peter. Mark wrote from Rome about what year? Mark likely wrote his gospel around 65\u201370 AD from Rome. Whose preaching did Mark represent as he wrote? Mark represented the preaching of the Apostle Peter. Mark wrote his gospel primarily for whom? Mark wrote primarily for a Gentile (non-Jewish) audience. LUKE What was Luke\u2019s relationship to Jesus? Luke was not one of Jesus\u2019 disciples but a physician and companion of the Apostle Paul. Luke wrote from Caesarea or Rome about what year? Luke likely wrote his gospel around 70\u201385 AD , potentially from Caesarea or Rome. Whose preaching did Luke represent as he wrote? Luke represented the preaching and teachings of the Apostle Paul. Luke wrote his gospel primarily for whom? Luke wrote primarily for a Gentile audience, particularly addressing \"Theophilus\". What problems do they see with the \u2018Synoptic Problem\u2019? The Synoptic Problem The \"Synoptic Problem\" refers to the question of how to explain the similarities and differences among the Synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Scholars observe that these gospels often contain parallel material, sometimes word-for-word, but also include unique content. Theories about their relationships (e.g., which gospel was written first and what sources they used) lead to debates over authorship, composition, and historical reliability. In Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels essays 3-5 deal with the critics of the gospels and their theories. Each gives answers to these theories. Either working alone or in a group, choose an essay: \u201cSource criticism\u201d, \u201cForm Criticism\u201d, or \u201cRedaction Criticism\u201d to read and then answer these questions: What is source, form, or redaction criticism? The definition of source criticism is at the bottom of page 274: \"This method investigates the written sources that gospel writers may have used, such as the theory that Mark or a hypothetical 'Q' document served as sources for Matthew and Luke.\" The definition of form criticism is at the bottom of page 280: \"This approach examines the oral traditions behind the gospel accounts, classifying them into literary forms (e.g., parables, miracles) to study their historical and cultural origins.\" The definition of redaction criticism is in the second paragraph of page 287: \"This method analyzes how gospel writers edited and arranged their material to emphasize specific theological themes or address the needs of their audiences.\" How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels? Source Criticism : It relies on speculative sources like \"Q\" without direct evidence and overlooks the role of oral tradition. Form Criticism : It assumes the gospel material is fragmented and dismisses the reliability of oral tradition in preserving accurate history. Redaction Criticism : It exaggerates the editorial role of gospel writers, undermining their historical reliability. What is the answer to this type of criticism? Source Criticism : The gospels rely on trustworthy oral tradition and eyewitness testimony, guided by divine inspiration. Form Criticism : The gospels are unified, reliable narratives, not fragmented oral traditions. Redaction Criticism : The gospel writers emphasized theology while preserving historical truth. Definition Weaknesses Answer Source Criticism This method investigates the written sources that gospel writers may have used, such as the theory that Mark or a hypothetical \"Q\" document served as sources for Matthew and Luke. Relies on speculative sources like \"Q,\" lacks direct evidence, and underestimates the role of oral tradition and eyewitness testimony. The gospels rely on trustworthy oral tradition and eyewitness testimony, guided by divine inspiration. Form Criticism This approach examines the oral traditions behind the gospel accounts, classifying them into literary forms (e.g., parables, miracles) to study their historical and cultural origins. Assumes the gospel material is fragmented and dismisses the reliability of oral tradition in preserving accurate history. The gospels are unified, reliable narratives, not fragmented oral traditions. Redaction Criticism This method analyzes how gospel writers edited and arranged their material to emphasize specific theological themes or address the needs of their audiences. Exaggerates the editorial role of gospel writers and undermines their historical reliability. The gospel writers emphasized theology while preserving historical truth. Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament pp. 40-43 beginning with \u201cA Comparison of the Four Gospels.\u201d What is the synoptic problem, the proposed solutions and the historic view of the church? The Synoptic Problem explores the similarities and differences between Matthew, Mark, and Luke, with proposed solutions like Markan priority (Mark as the first gospel) and the hypothetical \"Q\" source, while the historic church view emphasizes the gospels' divine inspiration and reliance on eyewitness testimony. Write an \u201cI believe\u201d statement that begins, \u201cI believe that the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, though very similar in content and structure, are divinely inspired. They were written at the proper time to address the specific needs of their respective audiences, offering edification and hope to persecuted saints. God's providence ensured their unique yet harmonious accounts, demonstrating His intentional design to deliver the Living Word to generations of believers. These gospels provide encouragement, hope, and the foundation for salvation, affirming that \"faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\" (Romans 10:17).\u201d Matthew 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45 and Luke 5:12-16 are considered to be an example of the same event in each of the synoptic gospels. Read Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels p. 53. Note the similarities between them. What differences can you find? Similarities: Core Event : All three accounts describe the same event\u2014a leper approaches Jesus, requests healing, and Jesus heals him by touching him and declaring him clean. Messianic Miracle : Each gospel highlights this as a miraculous act, fulfilling messianic expectations. Jesus directs the healed leper to show himself to the priests as a testimony, referencing the Mosaic Law. Audience-Specific Relevance : The event is particularly meaningful for Jewish audiences (as Matthew emphasizes) because the act of showing oneself to the priests symbolized the validation of Jesus as the Messiah, something Romans and Greeks might not grasp. Differences: Details in Luke : The Gospel of Luke provides additional context about Jesus\u2019 actions afterward, such as His withdrawal to pray in solitude after the miracle. Narrative Focus : Matthew focuses on the messianic significance for Jewish readers. Mark emphasizes the growing publicity of Jesus\u2019 ministry as the healed man spreads the news widely, even though Jesus instructs him not to. Luke highlights Jesus' personal habits, such as His tendency to withdraw for prayer after impactful events. What does the way Jesus deals with lepers tell us about Jesus\u2019 concerns of those of the culture in which He lived? The way Jesus deals with lepers demonstrates His disregard for cultural stigmas and Pharisaic oral laws regarding ritual uncleanliness, highlighting His divine authority and compassion. By touching the leper, Jesus showed that He was not affected by the leper's impurity but instead conveyed purity and healing, prioritizing the restoration of individuals over societal or religious taboos. Why would touching be significant to each of the authors given what you know about them? Why do you think that Mark gives more detail? Significance of Touching in Each Gospel Matthew : Touching the leper emphasizes Jesus\u2019 authority as the Messiah, fulfilling Jewish expectations and demonstrating His power to restore both physical and spiritual purity. This resonates with Matthew\u2019s Jewish audience, showing Jesus as the one who transcends ceremonial law. Mark : Mark\u2019s emphasis on Jesus\u2019 touch highlights His compassion and direct engagement with human suffering. Mark often portrays Jesus as a man of action, and the detailed description serves to show the immediacy and intensity of Jesus\u2019 miracles, appealing to his likely Gentile audience who valued tangible demonstrations of power. Luke : Luke, a physician, underscores the humanity of Jesus and His willingness to physically engage with the marginalized. The act of touching reflects Luke\u2019s broader theme of Jesus\u2019 concern for outcasts and His role as the compassionate Savior for all people. Why Does Mark Give More Detail? Mark\u2019s gospel is action-oriented, often emphasizing vivid details to engage his audience. The additional detail in Mark could also reflect Peter\u2019s firsthand account, as Mark is believed to have drawn from Peter\u2019s testimony. The detail enhances the narrative\u2019s immediacy and emotional impact, helping the reader feel the gravity of the miracle and Jesus\u2019 defiance of cultural norms.","title":"NTSurvey - Session 5 Part 1"},{"location":"NTSurvey/NTSurveyS5AssignmentPt1/#matthew","text":"What was Matthew\u2019s relationship to Jesus?
