### Theme of Jude

With a specific group of believers in mind. It speaks to them about false teachers, and is speculated that he wrote it to the same group as his brother James wrote to (James 1:1).

## Jude Summary

***In Jude, the author*** writes urgently to believers, appealing for them to contend earnestly for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints (*v. 3*). Certain individuals have secretly slipped into the church—ungodly people who distort grace into license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ as Master and Lord (*v. 4*). Jude warns that their judgment is certain, drawing on multiple Old Testament and Jewish precedents: Israel’s unbelief after being saved from Egypt, the angels who left their proper domain, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (*vv. 5–7*). He describes these false teachers vividly as defilers, arrogant dreamers, and those who reject authority. They are compared to Cain, Balaam, and Korah—each a warning example of rebellion (*v. 11*). Jude continues with powerful metaphors: they are hidden reefs, waterless clouds, fruitless trees, wild waves, and wandering stars for whom darkness has been reserved (*vv. 12–13*). He cites Enoch’s prophecy that the Lord will come with myriads of His holy ones to execute judgment on all the ungodly (*vv. 14–15*). These false teachers are grumblers, self-centered flatterers, and mockers who follow their own ungodly lusts, causing divisions because they are devoid of the Spirit (*vv. 16–19*). In contrast, believers are called to build themselves up on the most holy faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, remain in the love of God, and wait for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life (*vv. 20–21*). Jude instructs them to show mercy to the doubting, save others by snatching them from the fire, and approach still others with caution, hating even the garment stained by the flesh (*vv. 22–23*). The letter ends with one of Scripture’s most exalted doxologies, praising God who is able to keep His people from stumbling and present them blameless with great joy (*vv. 24–25*).

**Old Testament and Jewish References in Jude:**  

- Israel’s unbelief — Numbers 14 (*Jude 5*)  
- Fallen angels — Genesis 6 / 1 Enoch (background to *Jude 6*)  
- Sodom and Gomorrah — Genesis 19 (*Jude 7*)  
- Michael and the devil disputing over Moses’ body — Jewish tradition (reflected in *Jude 9*)  
- Cain — Genesis 4 (*Jude 11*)  
- Balaam — Numbers 22–24; 31:16 (*Jude 11*)  
- Korah’s rebellion — Numbers 16 (*Jude 11*)  
- Enoch’s prophecy — 1 Enoch 1:9 (*Jude 14–15*)  

**Precedence Principle Noted in Jude:**  
Jude’s entire argument is built on precedence: God has always judged unbelief, rebellion, and false teaching, and He will do so again. Israel, the fallen angels, and Sodom serve as historical patterns demonstrating that privilege does not prevent judgment. Likewise, Cain, Balaam, and Korah embody the recurrent forms of rebellion—self-will, greed, and rejection of God’s appointed authority. Even Jude’s use of unnamed traditions (such as Michael contending with the devil) mirrors the anonymity theme found in Hebrews: the identity of the intermediary is not central—the pattern is. All precedents converge upon a single truth: the Lord will come in judgment and will preserve the faithful. Jude uses these shadows and warnings to direct believers back to the substance—the mercy, love, and keeping power of Jesus Christ.

***Christ is presented as*** the only Master and Lord who safeguards His people, keeps them from falling, extends mercy unto eternal life, and will return with holy ones to execute righteous judgment on the ungodly. He is the One who loves, preserves, sustains, and ultimately presents His people blameless with great joy. Every warning and every promise in the letter centers upon His authority and saving power.

***Believers should*** contend for the faith, remain in God’s love, pray in the Holy Spirit, show discerning mercy to those in danger, and keep their hope fixed on the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life (*vv. 3, 20–23*).

### Salutation

**The Warnings of History to the Ungodly** *(1-16)*  

> 1 Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James,  
> To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:  
> 2 May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.  

### The Issue of False Teachers

> 3 Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.  
> 4 For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.  

### The History of False Teachers

> 5 Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.  
> 6 And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day,  
> 7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.  

### The Description of False Teachers

> 8 Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties.  
> 9 But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, *“The Lord rebuke you!”*  
> 10 But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.  
> 11 Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.  
> 12 These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;  
> 13 wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.  
> 14 It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, *“Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones,*  
> 15 *to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”*  
> 16 These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage.

### The Resistance to False Teachers

**Keep Yourselves in the Love of God** *(17-25)*  

> 17 But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
> 18 that they were saying to you, *“In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts.”*  
> 19 These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.  
> 20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,  
> 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.  
> 22 And have mercy on some, who are doubting;  
> 23 save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh.  

### Doxology

> 24 Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,  
> 25 to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.

## Class Exercise

Read Jude.

Look up the following verses and state some of Jude’s history: Jn. 7:3-5, Acts 1:14, 1 Cor. 9:5.  
**Write on a white board what each reference tells about Jude’s life story. John 7:3-5, His unbelieving brothers challenged his ministry.**  
**Acts 1:14, After the resurrection His brothers came to believe in Him. 1 Cor. 9:5, The Lord’s brothers were traveling evangelists like the apostles.**  

Based on these verses and Jude’s implied disclaimer in Jude 1:17, tell the story of Jude as you imagine it.  
**Have your students tell what they think, and then you summarize.**  

Compare 2 Timothy 3:1-8, 2 Peter 2:1-3:4 and Jude 4-18.  
How would you describe the heresy that the church faced at the end of the first and beginning of the second centuries?  
**Draw from these verses the characteristics of the heretics. 2 Tim. 3:1-8, It is a self-serving and immoral religion that opposes the truth 2 Pet. 2:1-3:4, It is a subversive teaching that denies the person and work of Jesus and seeks to draw others into immorality. Jude 4-18, They clandestinely enter the church to destroy its fellowship and deny its authority.**  

Find in Jude terse, poetic and compassionate language.  
**An example is vv. 19-20.**  

How do you think Jude intended his readers to *“contend for the faith”?*  
**Connect the apologetic against heretics in vv. 3 – 16 with the call for mercy in v. 22. The point is to see that contending is a combination of a strong apologetic with mercy for those who have been misled.**
