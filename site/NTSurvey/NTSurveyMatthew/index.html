<h3 id="matthew-chapters-1-4"><strong>Matthew: Chapters 1-4</strong></h3>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-1"><strong>Matthew Chapter 1</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 1, Matthew</em></strong> traces Jesus’ genealogy from Abraham to David, through the Babylonian exile, and finally to Christ. <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the King of David, the Root of Jesse (<em>Isaiah 11:1</em>), and the Lion of Judah (<em>Genesis 49:9-10</em>). <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> be convicted to examine the Scriptures daily (<em>Acts 17:11</em>) and be enlightened by the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Jesus’ genealogy (vs. 1-17). They should worship Him as Emmanuel, <em>“God with us”</em> (vs. 23), acknowledging Him as the Savior who will <em>“save His people from their sins”</em> (vs. 21).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-2"><strong>Matthew Chapter 2</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 2, Matthew</em></strong> recounts the visit of the Magi, Herod’s plot to kill Jesus, and the holy family’s flight to Egypt, fulfilling multiple Old Testament prophecies (<em>Micah 5:2, Hosea 11:1, Jeremiah 31:15</em>). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the King of the Jews, whose birth was divinely guided and protected despite worldly opposition. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> see how God fulfills His promises (<em>Numbers 23:19</em>) and trust in His providence through trials (<em>Psalm 34:19</em>). They should seek Christ and honor Him as the King (vs. 11).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-3"><strong>Matthew Chapter 3</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 3, Matthew</em></strong> introduces John the Baptist, who prepares the way of the Lord by calling people to repentance and baptizing them in the Jordan River. Jesus is baptized, and the heavens open, with the Spirit descending like a dove and the Father declaring, <em>“This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased”</em> (vs. 17). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the beloved Son, who identifies with humanity through His baptism and begins His public ministry. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> repent of their sins, as John proclaimed (vs. 2), and follow Jesus’ example by publicly committing their lives to God through baptism (vs. 13-15).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-4"><strong>Matthew Chapter 4</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 4, Jesus</em></strong> is tempted by Satan in the wilderness, calls His first disciples, and begins His public ministry, preaching, <em>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”</em> (vs. 17). He demonstrates His power by healing the sick and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom to the people of Galilee. <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the victorious Redeemer, who overcame temptation and brought light to a people in darkness (<em>Isaiah 9:1-2</em>). <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> resist temptation by standing on God’s Word (vs. 4, 7, 10), repent as Jesus preached (vs. 17), and follow Him wholeheartedly, leaving behind anything that hinders their calling (vs. 19-22).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="section-ii-principles-announced"><strong>Section II: Principles Announced</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 4:12 - 7:29</em>  </p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-5"><strong>Matthew Chapter 5</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 5, Jesus</em></strong> delivers the Sermon on the Mount, beginning with the Beatitudes and teaching about the law, anger, adultery, divorce, oaths, and loving one’s enemies. <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the Teacher of Kingdom righteousness, calling His followers to live as salt and light in the world (vs. 13-16). <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> strive for a heart aligned with God’s will, embracing humility, mercy, and purity (vs. 3-10), and demonstrate love even to their enemies as Jesus commanded (vs. 44).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-6"><strong>Matthew Chapter 6</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 6, Jesus</em></strong> continues the Sermon on the Mount, teaching about giving, prayer, fasting, and trusting God for provision. He introduces the Lord’s Prayer as a model for communion with God (vs. 9-13) and warns against materialism, saying, <em>“Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness”</em> (vs. 33). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the one who reveals how to live a life pleasing to God through faith and devotion. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> give in secret (vs. 4), pray with sincerity (vs. 6), fast with humility (vs. 18), and trust God for their needs (vs. 25-34).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-7"><strong>Matthew Chapter 7</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 7, Jesus</em></strong> concludes the Sermon on the Mount by teaching about judging others, prayer, and the way to life, and ends with the parable of the wise and foolish builders. He warns about false prophets and emphasizes the necessity of doing the will of the Father to enter the kingdom of heaven (vs. 21). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the Judge and Guide to the narrow way, calling people to build their lives on His teachings. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> live with discernment (vs. 15-20), persist in prayer (vs. 7-8), and obey His words to build a firm foundation (vs. 24-27).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="section-iii-the-power-revealed"><strong>Section III: The Power Revealed</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 8:1 - 11:1</em>  </p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-8"><strong>Matthew Chapter 8</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 8, Jesus</em></strong> performs several miracles, including healing a leper (vs. 2-3), calming a storm (vs. 26), and casting out demons (vs. 32). He also emphasizes the cost of following Him (vs. 22). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the compassionate Healer and the one with power over nature, sickness, and the spiritual realm. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> have faith in Jesus’ power to save (vs. 10, 26) and follow Him wholeheartedly, regardless of personal cost (vs. 19-22).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-9"><strong>Matthew Chapter 9</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 9, Jesus</em></strong> forgives and heals a paralytic (vs. 2-7), calls Matthew to follow Him (vs. 9), and raises a dead girl while healing others. He also teaches about fasting (vs. 37). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the one who has the authority to forgive sins and calls sinners to repentance. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> trust Jesus for physical and spiritual healing (vs. 2), respond to His call to follow Him (vs. 9), and actively join the workers in bringing in the harvest, praying for more laborers (vs. 37-38).</p>
<h3 id="matthew-chapter-10"><strong>Matthew Chapter 10</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>In Chapter 10, Jesus</em></strong> sends out the twelve apostles with authority to heal and cast out demons, instructing them to proclaim, <em>“The kingdom of heaven is at hand”</em> (vs. 7). He warns them of persecution (vs. 22), but also encourages them, (vs. 28). <strong><em>Christ is presented as</em></strong> the sender of workers into the harvest and the one who strengthens His followers in the face of persecution. <strong><em>Believers should</em></strong> proclaim the good news fearlessly (vs. 7, 28), endure opposition (vs. 22), and prioritize their loyalty to Jesus above all else (vs. 37-39).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="section-iv-the-program-explained"><strong>Section IV: The Program Explained</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 11:2 - 13:53</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Chapter 11</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 11, Jesus</em> reassures John the Baptist that He is indeed the Messiah by pointing to His miraculous works. He condemns unrepentant cities for rejecting His message and invites those burdened and weary to find rest in Him, showing both judgment and compassion. <em>Christ was presented as</em> the “Expected One,” fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. <em>Believers should</em> recognize Jesus as the promised fulfillment of Old Testament Scripture and take seriously the consequences of those who reject His message, as demonstrated by His warnings to the unrepentant cities.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 12, Jesus</em> faces intensified rejection from the Pharisees, who accuse Him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul. He warns them of the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, a sin rooted in Israel's national rejection of Him as the Christ. Jesus marks this as a pivotal moment, shifting to parables as He continues to confront unbelief. <em>Christ was presented as</em> the rejected Messiah, whose authority and identity were challenged by the religious leaders. <em>Believers should</em> rejoice in the significance of this chapter, understanding Israel's rejection of the Messiah and the Kingdom, and be thankful that the offer of the Kingdom is now extended to the Gentiles, embracing the generous, free gift of grace.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 13, Jesus</em> uses parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, unveiling hidden truths and distinguishing genuine seekers from the hard-hearted. This separation reflects God’s sovereign grace, as the gospel is revealed to the humble and concealed from the proud. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the Pearl of Great Price, whose worth surpasses all else. <em>Believers should</em> recognize the immense value of the Kingdom and the great sacrifice Christ made, responding with gratitude and whole-hearted devotion as bondservants of Christ.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="section-v-the-purpose-declared"><strong>Section V: The Purpose Declared</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 13:54 - 19:2</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Chapter 14</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 14, Jesus</em> feeds the 5,000, the first miracle recorded in all four Gospels, demonstrating His ability to provide abundantly when the disciples bring their limited resources to Him. He also walks on water, testing His disciples' faith and demonstrating His divinity over creation. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the Messiah, the compassionate provider who meets the needs of the multitude, and the Sovereign Lord over creation. <em>Believers should</em> learn to bring their needs and inadequacies to Jesus, trusting in His power to provide and understanding that true faith means continually depending on Him, even in life’s storms.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 15</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 15, Jesus</em> rebukes the Pharisees for elevating human traditions above God’s commandments, emphasizing the need for inward purity. He honors the persistent faith of a Gentile woman and miraculously feeds 4,000 people, showing that His mission extends beyond Israel to include all who believe. <em>Christ was presented as</em> the compassionate Savior who honors genuine faith, even to the Gentiles. <em>Believers should</em> praise God for His grace that extends beyond the boundaries of Israel, He has not forgotten those who once did not know Him and that His mercy reaches all who come to Him in faith.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 16</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 16, Jesus</em> is tested by the Pharisees and Sadducees, who demand a sign, but He points to the sign of Jonah as a foreshadowing of His resurrection. Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ, and Jesus begins to teach about His impending suffering, instructing His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him, illustrating the cost of true discipleship. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the Messiah, affirmed by Peter’s declaration, <em>“You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</em> <em>Believers should</em> “deny themselves and take up their cross,” emphasizing the cost of true discipleship, and they are warned to guard against the spiritual corruption of false teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 17</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 17, Matthew</em> describes the Transfiguration, where Jesus’ divine glory is revealed to Peter, James, and John. Moses and Elijah appear, and God affirms Jesus as His beloved Son. Later, Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy whom the disciples could not cure, emphasizing the necessity of faith. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the majestic and glorious King, who reigns with divine authority over all creation. <em>Believers should</em> recognize this moment as a powerful confirmation of Jesus' true identity and honor Him as the Sovereign King who fulfills God’s redemptive plan.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 18</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 18, Jesus</em> teaches about the importance of humility and caring for "little ones," warning against causing others to stumble. He shares the Parable of the Lost Sheep, emphasizes reconciliation within the church, and illustrates the necessity of forgiveness through the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the compassionate and protective Shepherd, who values every individual and seeks to bring the lost back into His fold. <em>Believers should</em> embody childlike humility, take sin seriously, seek to reconcile broken relationships, and forgive others from the heart, just as God has forgiven them.</p>
<h3 id="section-vi-the-problems-presented"><strong>Section VI: The Problems Presented</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 19:3 - 26:2</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Chapter 19</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 19, Matthew depicts</em> the testing of Jesus by the Pharisees on the issue of divorce, mirroring the examination of the Passover lamb for blemishes. Jesus also blesses the children and teaches about the difficulty of a rich person entering the Kingdom, emphasizing humility and the eternal rewards awaiting those who follow Him. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the spotless Lamb, whose perfection endures every test by human intellect and religious scrutiny. <em>Believers should</em> embrace humility, serve with selflessness, and understand that the path to greatness in God’s Kingdom is marked by a childlike faith and a heart devoted to service.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 20</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 20, Jesus</em> teaches the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard, He then predicts His suffering, death, and resurrection for the third time and subtly alludes to the future of James and John, with James becoming the first martyr and John living the longest. Jesus emphasizes servant leadership. He also heals two blind men who call out to Him as the “Son of David,” demonstrating His compassion and Messianic authority. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the humble and sacrificial servant. <em>Believers should</em> strive to serve others selflessly in all humility and have eyes for eternal things, knowing our rewards will be great if we do the works God has planned beforehand, “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” <strong>(Ephesians 2:10)</strong></p>
<h3 id="crowd-misinterpretation-explained">Crowd misinterpretation explained</h3>
<p>The people of Jerusalem misinterpreted the nature of Jesus' kingship during His Triumphal Entry. They saw Him as a political and national deliverer, a humble yet victorious King who would overthrow their Roman oppressors and restore Israel to its former glory. However, they failed to grasp that He was first coming as the <em>suffering servant</em> foretold in <em>Isaiah 53</em>—the one who would bear the sins of His people, be crushed and beaten on their behalf, and bring about atonement for sin.</p>
<h3 id="the-deeper-spiritual-reality-of-jesus-entry"><strong>The Deeper Spiritual Reality of Jesus' Entry</strong></h3>
<p>While the crowd celebrated Jesus' arrival as a King and Judge, waving branches in hopes of imminent deliverance, they missed the crucial reality that He had come to offer Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Without this atonement—His death on the cross to bear the punishment for sin—there would be no basis for anyone to stand before God. Indeed, without His sacrificial work, every human being would be judged and found guilty before God, even before they were born.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 21</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 21, Jesus</em> enters Jerusalem triumphantly on a foal of a donkey, with people laying down their coats and spreading branches, symbolizing joy and anticipation of a victorious, humble King and Judge. The crowd misunderstood His mission, expecting immediate deliverance and judgment rather than recognizing Him as the suffering servant who would first be crushed for their sins. Jesus cleanses the temple, declaring it a house of prayer, and curses a barren fig tree, a symbolic act against fruitless religion. He teaches the Parable of the Vineyard, exposing Israel’s religious leaders and foreshadowing God’s judgment on their unfaithfulness. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the misunderstood Messiah, heralded as a King but ultimately coming to fulfill the role of the suffering servant, who would atone for the sins of His people before returning as Judge. <em>Believers should</em> reflect on the necessity of Christ’s atoning sacrifice and be thankful for His first coming as a Savior, understanding that without His work on the cross, we would face judgment without hope.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 22</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 22, Jesus</em> tells the Parable of the Wedding Feast, where the originally invited guests—representing Israel—refuse to come and even kill the King’s servants. In response, the King destroys their city, a prophetic reference to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., and then extends the invitation to the Gentiles, clothing them in His righteousness. Those who come to the feast without proper wedding attire are cast out, illustrating the necessity of being clothed in Christ’s righteousness rather than relying on self-righteousness. The religious leaders continue to test Jesus, but His answers reveal His divine wisdom and authority. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the sovereign King who, after being rejected by Israel, extends His gracious invitation to the Gentiles. <em>Believers should</em> understand that when they put their complete faith and trust in Christ, they are clothed with His righteousness and will one day participate in a magnificent feast prepared by the King of Kings. This truth calls for humility, gratitude, and a life devoted to honoring the gracious invitation of God.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 23</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 23, Jesus</em> delivers a scathing denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, pronouncing a series of woes upon them for their hypocrisy and spiritual blindness. He condemns their actions, such as placing heavy burdens on others while neglecting the weightier matters of the law like justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Jesus mourns over Jerusalem, lamenting its rejection of God’s messengers and foreshadowing the coming judgment for their unbelief. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the righteous Judge who exposes religious hypocrisy and the compassionate Savior who grieves over the lost. <em>Believers should</em> examine their own hearts for hypocrisy, strive to practice genuine faith marked by justice, mercy, and humility, and be moved by Christ’s compassion for the lost, praying for and seeking their salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 24</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 24, Jesus</em> delivers the Olivet Discourse, a prophetic message about the end times, including the destruction of the temple, signs of His coming, and the end of the age. He describes events such as wars, famines, earthquakes, and great tribulation, warning His disciples to stay alert and not be deceived by false messiahs. Jesus emphasizes the suddenness of His return, likening it to a thief in the night, and urges His followers to be watchful and faithful, as no one knows the day or the hour. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the prophetic Son of Man who will return in glory to judge the living and the dead. <em>Believers should</em> remain spiritually alert, discerning the signs of the times, and live faithfully in anticipation of Christ’s return, knowing that their hope is in His promised coming and the establishment of His Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 25</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 25, Jesus</em> continues the Olivet Discourse with three parables that emphasize the necessity of being prepared for His return and living faithfully in the present. The Parable of the Ten Virgins illustrates the importance of spiritual readiness, as only the wise virgins who kept their lamps filled with oil were prepared to meet the Bridegroom. The Parable of the Talents teaches that believers must use the gifts and responsibilities entrusted to them, as the faithful servants were rewarded, while the one who buried his talent was cast out. Finally, the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats describes the final judgment, where Christ separates people based on their actions, with the righteous entering eternal life and the unrighteous facing eternal punishment. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the Bridegroom who comes unexpectedly, the Master who entrusts His servants with responsibilities, and the King who judges the nations. <em>Believers should</em> be vigilant, actively use their God-given resources to serve Him, and demonstrate genuine faith through acts of love and compassion, knowing that their lives will be judged by how they have honored Christ.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="section-vii-the-passion-accomplished"><strong>Section VII: The Passion Accomplished</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 26:3 - 28:10</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Chapter 26</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 26, Jesus</em> prepares for His crucifixion, predicting His imminent betrayal and instituting the Last Supper, where He shares bread and wine as symbols of His body and blood given for the forgiveness of sins. Judas agrees to betray Jesus, and later, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prays in deep anguish, submitting to the Father's will. He is arrested and taken before the high priest, where He is falsely accused, mocked, and condemned, while Peter denies knowing Him three times, fulfilling Jesus’ earlier prediction. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the sacrificial Lamb who willingly submits to God’s redemptive plan, and the suffering Savior who experiences betrayal, sorrow, and rejection. <em>Believers should</em> reflect on Christ's sacrifice, understanding the depth of His love and commitment, and be steadfast in faith, even when facing trials and temptations.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 27</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 27, Jesus</em> is brought before Pilate, who reluctantly sentences Him to be crucified, despite finding no guilt in Him, as the crowd demands His death. Jesus is mocked, beaten, and crowned with thorns by Roman soldiers before being led to Golgotha, where He is crucified alongside two criminals. At His death, darkness covers the land, the temple veil is torn in two, and the earth quakes, signifying the profound spiritual significance of His sacrifice. Joseph of Arimathea then places Jesus' body in a tomb, and the religious leaders secure it with a guard, fearing His resurrection. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the suffering and sacrificial Savior, the King of the Jews who endures mockery and crucifixion to fulfill God’s redemptive plan. <em>Believers should</em> stand in awe of the depth of Jesus’ sacrifice, understanding that His death was the payment for sin and the fulfillment of prophecy, and trust in the power of His atoning work.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 28</strong><br />
<em>In Chapter 28, Jesus</em> rises from the dead, and the women who come to the tomb are greeted by an angel who announces His resurrection. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, instructing them to tell His disciples to meet Him in Galilee. Later, Jesus meets with His disciples and gives them the Great Commission, commanding them to <em>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.”</em> He promises to be with them always, even to the end of the age. <em>Christ is presented as</em> the risen Lord, victorious over death, and the sovereign King who commissions His followers to spread the gospel. <em>Believers should</em> rejoice in the hope of the resurrection, embrace their mission to make disciples of all nations, and live confidently in the presence and authority of the risen Christ.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="epilogue-the-great-commission"><strong>Epilogue: The Great Commission</strong></h3>
<p><em>Chapters 28:11 - 20</em>  </p>
<p><em>In this final section, Matthew</em> describes how the guards at Jesus’ tomb are bribed by the chief priests to spread a false report that His disciples stole His body. Meanwhile, Jesus meets His disciples in Galilee and delivers the Great Commission, instructing them to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey all He has commanded. He assures them of His presence, saying, <em>“And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”</em> <em>Christ is presented as</em> the risen and authoritative Lord who commands and empowers His followers to continue His mission. <em>Believers should</em> take the Great Commission seriously, spreading the gospel and making disciples, confident in the enduring presence and authority of Jesus.</p></div>
