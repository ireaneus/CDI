<p><strong>God's Kingdom, redeeming His people all for His Glory</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-chief-end-of-man-and-the-purpose-and-providence-of-god-chiastic-structure"><strong>The Chief End of Man and the Purpose and Providence of God (Chiastic Structure)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A. The Glory of God and the Ultimate Purpose of Man</strong><br />
I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever, finding our ultimate satisfaction in Him. <em>"Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory."</em> <strong>(Isaiah 43:6-7)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. The Goodness and Satisfaction Found in God</strong><br />
God is the source of all that is truly good and satisfying. <em>"O taste and see that the Lord is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"</em> <strong>(Psalm 34:8)</strong>. Our hearts find rest in God alone, <em>"My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?"</em> <strong>(Psalm 42:2)</strong>. <em>"For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good."</em> <strong>(Psalm 107:9)</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. The Center: God's Sovereign Providence and Our Daily Life</strong><br />
I believe in the providence of God, whereby He governs all events according to His eternal plan, upholding all things in heaven and on earth. <em>"In Him we live and move and have our being."</em> <strong>(Acts 17:28)</strong>. While I am responsible for my actions, His providential care directs my path. Nothing is beyond His control, as He works all things according to the counsel of His will. <em>"The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."</em> <strong>(Proverbs 16:9)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>B’. The Rest and Fulfillment Found in God's Presence</strong><br />
God provides true joy and fulfillment in His presence, where our deepest longings are met. <em>"In Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."</em> <strong>(Psalm 16:11)</strong>. Even through every joy and trial, He is near, working all things together for the good of those who love Him. <em>"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."</em> <strong>(Romans 8:28)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A’. Living to the Glory of God in All We Do</strong><br />
In all aspects of life, we are called to glorify God, giving thanks for His goodness and sovereignty. Our highest calling is to live in worship and obedience to Him, finding our greatest joy in His presence. <em>"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 10:31)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-bible">The Bible</h2>
<p>I believe that the Bible is God’s written revelation to humanity, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments. It is <em>"inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work"</em> <strong>(2 Timothy 3:16-17)</strong>. These Scriptures, being <em>"spoken from God as men were moved by the Holy Spirit"</em> <strong>(2 Peter 1:21)</strong>, are inerrant, infallible, and immutable in their original form, serving as the perfect and authoritative guide for faith and practice.</p>
<p>God's Word endures forever, for <em>"until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished"</em> <strong>(Matthew 5:18)</strong>. It is "truth," as Jesus prayed, <em>"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth"</em> <strong>(John 17:17)</strong>. The Bible is to be interpreted literally and contextually, recognizing its historical and grammatical context, such as <em>"God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day"</em> <strong>(Genesis 1:31)</strong>.</p>
<p>While there is but one true interpretation of each passage, there are many applications that flow from that interpretation. Believers are called to discern the true meaning of Scripture, guided by the Holy Spirit, so that they may <em>"prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect"</em> <strong>(Romans 12:2)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-nature-of-god">The Nature of God</h2>
<p>I believe that God is eternal, infinite, and unchanging, existing as one essence in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <em>"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God"</em> <strong>(Psalm 90:2)</strong>. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, possessing all power and knowledge, and <em>"His sovereignty rules over all"</em> <strong>(Psalm 103:19)</strong>. God is perfectly holy and just, <em>"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory"</em> <strong>(Isaiah 6:3)</strong>, and His judgments are always righteous.</p>
<p>God is also good, the source of all that is good, as it is written, <em>"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"</em> <strong>(Psalm 34:8)</strong>. He is self-existent, declaring, <em>"I AM WHO I AM"</em> <strong>(Exodus 3:14)</strong>, having no beginning or end, and <em>"His throne is established in the heavens"</em> <strong>(Psalm 103:19)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-nature-of-god-attributes-of-god">The Nature of God: Attributes of God</h3>
<p><strong>Eternal</strong>: God exists outside of time, without beginning or end.<br />
<em>"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God."</em> <strong>(Psalm 90:2)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infinite</strong>: God is limitless in His presence, knowledge, and power, filling all things.<br />
<em>"Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?"</em> <strong>(Jeremiah 23:24)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Immutable</strong>: God is unchanging in His nature, character, and promises.<br />
<em>"For I, the Lord, do not change."</em> <strong>(Malachi 3:6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Omnipotent</strong>: I believe that God is sovereign over all creation, doing whatever He pleases in heaven, earth, and the seas. <em>'For I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods. Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.'</em> <strong>(Psalm 135:5-6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Omnipresent</strong>: God is present everywhere, and there is no place where He is not.<br />
<em>"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"</em> <strong>(Psalm 139:7-10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Omniscient</strong>: God knows all things, past, present, and future.<br />
<em>"I am God, and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning."</em> <strong>(Isaiah 46:9-10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Holy</strong>: God is absolutely pure, set apart from sin, and perfectly righteous.<br />
<em>"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory."</em> (Isaiah 6:3)</p>
<p><strong>Just</strong>: God's ways are always right and fair; He is the standard of justice.<br />
<em>"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are just."</em> <strong>(Deuteronomy 32:4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: God is the source of all goodness, and He acts with kindness and mercy.<br />
<em>"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"</em> <strong>(Psalm 34:8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sovereign</strong>: God exercises supreme authority over all creation.<br />
<em>"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all."</em> <strong>(Psalm 103:19)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Self-existent</strong>: God exists by His own power and is dependent on nothing else.<br />
<em>"I AM WHO I AM."</em> <strong>(Exodus 3:14)</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-nature-of-god-the-trinity"><strong>The Nature of God: The Trinity</strong></h3>
<p>The doctrine of the Trinity reveals that there is one God, existing eternally in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The oneness of God is fundamental, affirming that He alone is divine: <em>"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!"</em> <strong>(Deuteronomy 6:4)</strong>. Each person of the Godhead is distinct, yet together they share one divine essence. Jesus affirms this in His command to baptize in the singular name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which shows both their unity and individual persons within the Godhead: <em>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."</em> <strong>(Matthew 28:19)</strong>. The unity of essence and distinction of persons are confirmed in John’s epistle, which states, <em>"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."</em> <strong>(1 John 5:7)</strong>. Additionally, each person of the Trinity maintains a unique relationship with believers and with one another, as expressed in Paul’s benediction: <em>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 13:14)</strong>.</p>
<p>The holiness of the Trinity is central to God’s nature, with each person—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—existing in absolute purity and moral perfection. In heavenly visions, God is worshiped with the thrice-repeated exclamation, <em>"Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come."</em> <strong>(Revelation 4:8)</strong>. This threefold declaration underscores the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, affirming their co-equality in divine holiness. The triune God is the ultimate source and standard of all that is holy, entirely distinct from creation and without any imperfection.</p>
<p>Each person of the Trinity is holy. The Father’s holiness is manifested in His complete separation from sin and His inability to approve evil: <em>"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor."</em> <strong>(Habakkuk 1:13)</strong>. Jesus, the Son, lived a sinless life as the Lamb of God, perfect in purity and blamelessness, who sacrificed Himself to redeem humanity: <em>"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."</em> <strong>(1 Peter 1:19)</strong>. The Holy Spirit, who indwells believers, sanctifies and makes them holy as the temple of God, <em>"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 3:16-17)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-nature-of-god-god-the-father">The Nature of God: God the Father</h3>
<p>God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, is the sovereign Creator of all things. <em>"For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 8:6)</strong>. He ordains all things according to His will and purpose, exercising authority over all creation, providence, and redemption. His fatherhood is twofold: He is the Creator and Father of all humanity, <strong>"one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all."</strong> <strong>(Ephesians 4:6)</strong>, but He is the spiritual Father only to those who are in Christ, having adopted them into His family through faith, <em>"For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."</em> <strong>(Romans 8:14)</strong>.</p>
<p>God the Father has decreed all things for His glory and continually upholds and governs all creatures and events, <em>"Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power… indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth."</em> <strong>(1 Chronicles 29:11)</strong>. In His holiness, He neither authors nor approves of sin, <em>"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil."</em> <strong>(Habakkuk 1:13)</strong>, and He preserves the moral accountability of His creation. From eternity past, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His children, <em>"to the praise of the glory of His grace."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:6)</strong>, blessing them with every spiritual blessing in Christ, <em>"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:4)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-nature-of-god-god-the-son">The Nature of God: God the Son</h3>
<p>I believe that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, is fully God and fully man, possessing two distinct natures in one person. He is the eternal Son of God, <em>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"</em> <strong>(John 1:1)</strong>. <em>Through Him, all things were created, and He is the radiance of God’s glory, "upholding all things by the word of His power"</em> <strong>(Hebrews 1:3)</strong>.</p>
<p>Jesus was born of a virgin (Matthew 1:23), lived a sinless life, and fulfilled the Law perfectly. He willingly went to the cross, <em>"bearing our sins in His body on the tree"</em> <strong>(1 Peter 2:24)</strong>, and died as a substitutionary atonement for humanity’s sins. He rose bodily from the dead on the third day, <em>"according to the Scriptures"</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)</strong>, <em>conquering sin and death, and ascended into heaven, where He is seated at the right hand of the Father</em> <strong>(Hebrews 1:3)</strong>.</p>
<p>Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, establishing His eternal kingdom, <em>"for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet"</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 15:25)</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="key-roles-and-attributes-of-god-the-son">Key Roles and Attributes of God the Son</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eternal Sonship: Jesus is eternally God, distinct in person, but equal in essence with the Father.</strong><br />

</ul>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-god-god-the-holy-spirit">The Nature of God: God the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>I believe that the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is fully God, co-equal with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit was active in creation, <em>"moving over the surface of the waters"</em> <strong>(Genesis 1:2)</strong>, and is now the divine agent in regeneration and sanctification. <em>He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment</em> <strong>(John 16:8)</strong> and indwells every believer, <em>sealing them for the day of redemption</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:13-14)</strong>.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit empowers believers for service, imparts spiritual gifts, and produces the fruit of the Spirit in their lives. He leads and guides believers into all truth, <em>"for He will guide you into all the truth"</em> <strong>(John 16:13)</strong>, and illuminates the Word of God, enabling its application.</p>
<h4 id="key-roles-and-attributes-of-god-the-holy-spirit">Key Roles and Attributes of God the Holy Spirit</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Divine Person: The Holy Spirit is fully God and co-equal with the Father and Son.</strong><br />

<em>"The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters."</em> <strong>(Genesis 1:2)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Convictor of Sin: The Holy Spirit brings conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</strong><br />
<em>"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment."</em> <strong>(John 16:8)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indwelling Presence: He resides in all believers, empowering them to live godly lives.</strong><br />

</li>
<li>

<em>"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth."</em> <strong>(John 16:13)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Giver of Spiritual Gifts: The Spirit distributes spiritual gifts for the edification of the Church.</strong><br />
<em>"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 12:11)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-decrees-of-god"><strong>The Decrees of God</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that the <strong>Decrees of God</strong> are His eternal ordinances, established in His perfect wisdom and will, by which He determined to accomplish His purposes. These decrees are absolute, sovereign, and unchangeable, encompassing all that will ever happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eternal and Unchangeable Plan</strong>: From eternity, God has had a plan that does not change, set forth before the foundation of the world.<br />
<em>Says the Lord, who makes these things known from long ago</em> <strong>(Acts 15:18)</strong><br />
<em>just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:4)</strong><br />
<em>But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.</em> <strong>(2Thes 2:13)</strong>.<br />
<em>he counsel of the Lord stands forever, The plans of His heart from generation to generation.</em> <strong>(Psalms 33:11)</strong><br />
<em>Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,</em> <strong>(Isaiah 46:9)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Determination of All Things</strong>: God comprehends and determines all events that come to pass, working all things according to His sovereign will.<br />
<em>"He works all things after the counsel of His will."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:11)</strong>.<br />
<em>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered</em> <strong>(Matt. 10:29-30)</strong><br />
<em>"The king's heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He wishes."</em> <strong>(Proverbs 21:1)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>God’s Relationship to Sin</strong>: Although God decrees all things, He is not the author of sin and does not commit evil. God permits sin but always superintends it for His purposes, bringing about His perfect plan.<br />
<em>"This Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men."</em> <strong>(Acts 2:23)</strong><br />
<em>"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'"</em> <strong>(Job 1:12)</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sovereignty and Unconditional Nature</strong>: God's decrees are unconditional, independent of human action, and established by His sovereign will.<br />
<em>"He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:5)</strong><br />
<em>For truly * in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur.</em> <strong>(Acts 4:27-28)</strong>
  <em>"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven."</em> <strong>(Daniel 4:35)</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inevitability and Efficacy of God's Will</strong>:  The decrees of God are by His sovereign will, and nothing can hinder them.<br />
<em>'Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.'</em> <strong>(Psalm 135:6)</strong><br />
<em>For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</em> <strong>(Eph. 2:10)</strong>
  <em>"For who can resist His will?"</em> <strong>(Romans 9:19)</strong><br />
<em>"My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose."</em> <strong>(Isaiah 46:10, ESV)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency with God's Holy Nature</strong>: God's decrees are always perfectly consistent with His holy character. He remains pure and righteous in all His plans.<br />
<em>"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor."</em> <strong>(Habakkuk 1:13)</strong>  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-i-believe-about-angels"><strong>What I Believe About Angels</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve as His messengers and to accomplish His will. The term "angel" means "messenger," and while it may refer to other functions, it primarily describes their role in delivering God's messages or worshiping Him. <em>"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"</em> <strong>(Hebrews 1:14)</strong>. Angels were created at a specific time by God, before the creation of humanity, to reflect His glory. <em>"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible."</em> <strong>(Colossians 1:16)</strong>. They are not eternal like God but exist as immortal beings. <em>"For they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."</em> <strong>(Luke 20:36)</strong>.</p>
<p>Angels were created in great numbers and existed before the foundation of the world, rejoicing at the creation of the earth. <em>"When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy."</em> <strong>(Job 38:7)</strong>. They are a higher order of beings than humans, possessing greater strength and knowledge. <em>"What is man that You take thought of him? Yet You have made him a little lower than the angels."</em> <strong>(Psalm 8:4-5)</strong>. Angels are often referred to as the "Host of Heaven," symbolizing their role in God's heavenly army. <em>"I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left."</em> <strong>(2 Chronicles 18:18)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="roles-and-classes-of-angels"><strong>Roles and Classes of Angels</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael the Archangel</strong> is a warrior angel who defends God's people.<br />
<em>"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil..."</em> <strong>(Jude 1:9)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gabriel</strong> is a messenger angel, delivering significant announcements.<br />
<em>"I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news."</em> <strong>(Luke 1:19)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Seraphim</strong> worship God and guard His throne.<br />
<em>"Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings... and one called out to another and said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts.'"</em> <strong>(Isaiah 6:2-3)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cherubim</strong> guard sacred places, such as the Garden of Eden, the Shekinah Glory of God, and the mercy seat of God.<br />
<em>"So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim."</em> <strong>(Genesis 3:24)</strong>.
  <em>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.</em> <strong>(Eze 11:22)</strong>
  <em>and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</em> <strong>(Heb 9:5)</strong></li>

<h3 id="destiny-of-angels"><strong>Destiny of Angels</strong></h3>
<p>Angels will live eternally, either in God's presence or, for the fallen angels, in the Lake of Fire. <em>"Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels."</em> <strong>(Matthew 25:41)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-i-believe-about-satan"><strong>What I Believe About Satan</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that Satan is a real and personal being, a fallen angel who actively opposes God and His purposes. He is referred to as <em>"a murderer from the beginning... and the father of lies,"</em> <strong>(John 8:44)</strong>. His name, "Satan," meaning "adversary," reflects his opposition to God's work, while other titles such as "the devil" (slanderer) and "Beelzebub" (lord of the flies) emphasize his malicious nature and intent to deceive and destroy.</p>
<p>Originally, Satan was created as a beautiful and powerful cherumbin, endowed with wisdom and splendor. <em>"You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire."</em> <strong>(Ezekiel 28:12-14)</strong>. However, pride led to his downfall as he sought to elevate himself above God. <em>"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor."</em> <strong>(Ezekiel 28:17)</strong>. In his rebellion, Satan deceived a third of the angels to follow him, who are now his demons. <em>"His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth."</em> <strong>(Revelation 12:4)</strong>.</p>
<p>Though Satan wields significant power, he is neither omnipotent nor omnipresent and remains subject to God’s sovereign control. <em>"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'"</em> <strong>(Job 1:12)</strong>. Believers are called to resist Satan’s influence by submitting to God. <em>"Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you."</em> <strong>(James 4:7)</strong>. Demons, the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion, also work to deceive, influence, and harm humanity, blinding the minds of unbelievers, <em>"The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving."</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 4:4)</strong>.</p>
<p>Satan’s defeat was accomplished through the death and resurrection of Christ, who declared victory over him. <em>"The ruler of this world has been judged."</em> <strong>(John 16:11)</strong>. Ultimately, Satan’s final destiny is the Lake of Fire, where he and his demons will suffer eternal punishment. <em>"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:10)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-i-believe-about-the-nature-of-man"><strong>What I Believe About the Nature of Man</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that humanity was created uniquely by God in His image. <em>"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky.'"</em> <strong>(Genesis 1:26-27)</strong>. This image is not a literal or exact representation but reflects God's attributes in a finite and limited way.</p>
<p>In our original state, Adam and Eve were without sin and enjoyed a perfect relationship with God. <em>"Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."</em> <strong>(Genesis 2:7)</strong>. <em>"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place."</em> <strong>(Genesis 2:21-22)</strong>. Man's nature consisted of both a physical body and an immaterial soul or spirit. <em>"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</em> <strong>(1 Thessalonians 5:23)</strong>.</p>
<p>However, through the Fall, humanity's moral and spiritual likeness to God has been corrupted, resulting in the universal sinfulness of all people. <em>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</em> <strong>(Romans 3:23)</strong>. Yet, through Christ, the image of God is being restored in believers, and it will be perfected at His return. <em>"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit."</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 3:18)</strong>. <em>"Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 15:49)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-i-believe-about-sin"><strong>What I Believe About Sin</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that <strong>sin</strong> is any failure to conform to God’s moral law in action, attitude, or nature. Sin originated with Satan's rebellion against God and entered humanity through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. <em>"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned."</em> <strong>(Romans 5:12)</strong>. Sin separates us from God, corrupting the <strong>image of God</strong> in us and resulting in both physical and spiritual death. <em>"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."</em> <strong>(Romans 6:23)</strong>.</p>
<p>The origin of sin lies in Satan's initial rebellion, followed by the fall of humanity. Created as a powerful angel, Satan became corrupted by pride, <em>"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty."</em> <strong>(Ezekiel 28:17)</strong>, and subsequently led Adam and Eve into disobedience, as they ate from the forbidden tree. All descendants of Adam inherit this sinful nature, inclining us toward sin from birth, <em>"There is none righteous, not even one."</em> <strong>(Romans 3:10)</strong>. Sin pervades every part of our being—mind, will, and emotions—leaving humanity incapable of pleasing God apart from His grace. <em>"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?"</em> <strong>(Jeremiah 17:9)</strong>.</p>
<p>Sin has devastating consequences. It creates a barrier between humanity and God, disrupting the relationship we were made to enjoy with Him, <em>"Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God."</em> <strong>(Isaiah 59:2)</strong>. Beyond spiritual death, sin also affects creation itself, which now suffers under a curse, <em>"For the creation was subjected to futility."</em> <strong>(Romans 8:20)</strong>.</p>
<p>Different types of sin include <strong>original sin</strong>, the inherited sinful nature from Adam, <strong>personal sins</strong> committed by each individual, and <strong>sins of commission and omission</strong>—acts of disobedience as well as failures to act in righteousness. <em>"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us."</em> <strong>(1 John 1:8)</strong>.</p>
<p>God has provided the ultimate remedy for sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus bore our sins and offers redemption to all who believe in Him, <em>"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross."</em> <strong>(1 Peter 2:24)</strong>. In Christ, believers are called to confess their sins and find forgiveness, <em>"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</em> <strong>(1 John 1:9)</strong>, with the promise of being conformed to His image, <em>"We all... are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 3:18)</strong>.</p>
<p>For those in Christ, victory over sin is achieved through the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to live in righteousness and pursue ongoing sanctification, <em>"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace."</em> <strong>(Romans 6:14)</strong>. This sanctification process continues throughout life, as God works in believers to make them more like His Son, <em>"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."</em> <strong>(1 Thessalonians 4:3)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="salvation-soteriology"><strong>Salvation (Soteriology)</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that <strong>Salvation</strong> is a gracious gift from God, given by His mercy and not earned by human effort. It is received through faith in <strong>Jesus Christ alone</strong>, who accomplished our redemption through His life, death, and resurrection. Salvation is entirely of grace, based on the work of Christ, and applied by the Holy Spirit. As Scripture declares, <em>"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."</em> (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>
<h3 id="the-basis-of-salvation"><strong>The Basis of Salvation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>By Grace Alone</strong>: Salvation is entirely an act of God's grace, undeserved and unearned.<br />
<em>"He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit."</em> (Titus 3:5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Through Faith Alone</strong>: It is accessed solely through faith, trusting in Christ's finished work on the cross.<br />
<em>"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."</em> (Romans 5:1)<br />
<em>"For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law."</em> (Romans 3:28)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In Christ Alone</strong>: Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity. His sacrificial death and victorious resurrection secured our salvation.<br />
<em>"There is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."</em> (Acts 4:12)<br />
<em>"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God."</em> (1 Peter 3:18)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-process-of-salvation"><strong>The Process of Salvation</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Election</strong>: God's choice of certain individuals for salvation was made before the foundation of the world.<br />
<em>"He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."</em> (Ephesians 1:4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: The work of the Holy Spirit in giving new spiritual life to the believer.<br />
<em>"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."</em> (John 3:3)<br />
<em>"He saved us... by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit."</em> (Titus 3:5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: The act of God declaring a sinner righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness.<br />
<em>"Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."</em> (Romans 3:24)<br />
<em>"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</em> (2 Corinthians 5:21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sanctification</strong>: The ongoing process of being made holy, conformed to the image of Christ.<br />
<em>"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."</em> (1 Thessalonians 4:3)<br />
<em>"We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."</em> (2 Corinthians 3:18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Glorification</strong>: The final step of salvation, where believers are fully conformed to the likeness of Christ and free from the presence of sin.<br />
<em>"Whom He predestined, He also called; and whom He called, He also justified; and whom He justified, He also glorified."</em> (Romans 8:30)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-result-of-salvation"><strong>The Result of Salvation</strong></h3>
<p>Salvation brings about reconciliation with God, adoption as His children, and eternal life. Believers are united with Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and assured of eternal security. <em>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."</em> (John 3:16). We are saved to the glory of God alone, for His purpose and praise. <em>"To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling... to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory."</em> (Jude 1:24-25).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-church"><strong>The Church</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that the Church is the body of Christ, a spiritual organism made up of all believers from the day of Pentecost to the Rapture. It is composed of those who have been called out by God from all nations to form one unified body, <em>"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 12:13)</strong>. The Church is distinct from Israel and was established as a new entity at Pentecost.</p>
<h3 id="the-universal-and-local-church"><strong>The Universal and Local Church</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>universal Church</strong> consists of all true believers in Christ, forming a spiritual body where Christ is the head, <em>"And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 1:22-23)</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>local church</strong> refers to the visible gathering of believers in a specific location, committed to the teaching of God's Word, worship, fellowship, and observing the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper, <em>"They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer."</em> <strong>(Acts 2:42)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-purpose-of-the-church"><strong>The Purpose of the Church</strong></h3>
<p>The Church exists to glorify God by making His wisdom known, <em>"so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 3:10)</strong>, and to be a dwelling place for God by the Spirit, <em>"being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 2:20-21)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-functions-of-the-church"><strong>The Functions of the Church</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Worship</strong>: The Church gathers to praise and honor God, <em>"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."</em> <strong>(John 4:24)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism</strong>: The Church is commanded to spread the gospel to all nations, <em>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."</em> <strong>(Matthew 28:19)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Discipleship</strong>: The Church is tasked with teaching believers to grow in maturity, <em>"Teaching them to observe all that I commanded you."</em> <strong>(Matthew 28:20)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fellowship and Care</strong>: The Church is to care for its members, <em>"Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ."</em> <strong>(Galatians 6:2)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-future-of-the-church"><strong>The Future of the Church</strong></h3>
<p>The Church's future includes being raptured, rewarded, and reigning with Christ, <em>"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout...and the dead in Christ will rise first."</em> <strong>(1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)</strong>. Eventually, the Church will dwell with Christ in the New Jerusalem, <em>"Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them."</em> <strong>(Revelation 21:3)</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="heaven-and-hell"><strong>Heaven and Hell</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that <strong>Heaven</strong> and <strong>Hell</strong> are real and eternal destinations for all human beings after death. The existence of these places is clearly revealed in Scripture, and they reflect the ultimate outcomes of God's justice and grace.</p>
<h3 id="heaven"><strong>Heaven</strong></h3>
<p>Heaven is the eternal dwelling place of God, His elect angels, and all believers who have been redeemed through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a place of perfect peace, joy, and fellowship with God, where there is no more pain, suffering, or death. Scripture describes Heaven as the <strong>"Third Heaven,"</strong> the sacred abode of God, <em>"where God dwells and receives worship"</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 12:2-4)</strong>. In Heaven, God’s sovereignty and holiness are fully realized, <em>"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all."</em> <strong>(Psalm 103:19)</strong>. For believers, Heaven offers the blessed hope of being in the Lord’s presence immediately upon death, <em>"To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord."</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 5:8)</strong>. In the eternal state, Heaven will come down to the new earth as the New Jerusalem, where God will dwell with His people in a new and glorious creation, <em>"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."</em> <strong>(Revelation 21:2)</strong>. Heaven is also referred to as <strong>Paradise</strong>, a place of blessedness for the righteous. Following Christ’s ascension, Paradise shifted from Abraham's Bosom to the Third Heaven, and now, believers who die are taken to Heaven to be with the Lord.</p>
<h3 id="hell"><strong>Hell</strong></h3>
<p>Hell is the present place of torment for the souls of the unrighteous, serving as a temporary state of suffering until the final judgment. Often referred to in Scripture as <strong>Hades</strong> (the Greek equivalent of <strong>Sheol</strong>), Hell is described as the realm of the dead, where the wicked await their ultimate fate. It is a place of conscious torment, as Jesus illustrated in the story of the rich man in Hades: <em>"In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment."</em> <strong>(Luke 16:23)</strong>. The souls in Hell experience ongoing suffering and regret, <em>"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</em> <strong>(Matthew 13:42)</strong>. This place is reserved for those who have turned away from God, <em>"The wicked will return to Sheol, even all the nations who forget God."</em> <strong>(Psalm 9:17)</strong>. Hell reflects God’s justice and the reality of separation from His presence for those who reject His salvation.</p>
<h3 id="the-lake-of-fire-gehenna"><strong>The Lake of Fire (Gehenna)</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Lake of Fire</strong>, also known as <strong>Gehenna</strong>, is the final and eternal destination for the unrighteous following the final judgment. Unlike Hell (Hades), which is temporary, the Lake of Fire is a place of eternal punishment and separation from God, prepared for both fallen angels and humans who reject Christ. Scripture describes it as a place of unquenchable fire and utter darkness, <em>"It is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire."</em> <strong>(Mark 9:43)</strong>. This eternal separation from God is the ultimate penalty for sin, <em>"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord."</em> <strong>(2 Thessalonians 1:9)</strong>. At the final judgment, those not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into this Lake of Fire, <em>"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:15)</strong>, marking an irreversible state of separation and suffering in God’s final judgment against sin.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-resurrection"><strong>The Resurrection</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that the <strong>Resurrection</strong> is a multi-stage event in God's redemptive plan, ultimately bringing believers into eternal life with glorified bodies. It is central to the hope of the Christian faith and is described as taking place during what is often referred to as the <strong>Rapture</strong>. According to <strong>1 Thessalonians 4:13-17</strong>, this event encompasses the resurrection of the dead in Christ and the transformation of living believers. <em>"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord."</em> <strong>(1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-phases-of-the-resurrection"><strong>The Phases of the Resurrection</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Resurrection of the Dead in Christ</strong>:<br />
   At the Lord's return, those who have died in Christ will be raised with new, glorified bodies, <em>"The dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 15:52)</strong>. This resurrection marks the beginning of the fulfillment of immortality for the redeemed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Transformation of Living Believers</strong>:<br />
   Those who are alive at the time of Christ’s return will be transformed instantly, <em>"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 15:52)</strong>. This reference to the <strong>last trumpet</strong> is often associated with <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> (the Jewish New Year), known as the <strong>Feast of Trumpets</strong>, during which multiple trumpet blasts (shofar blasts) are sounded. The final, long blast called the <strong>Tekiah Gedolah</strong> is significant because it symbolizes awakening, repentance, and the anticipation of God's coming redemption. This connection enriches the understanding of the resurrection as a time of transformation and renewal, heralding Christ's return and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Bema Seat of Christ</strong>:<br />
   Following the resurrection and transformation, believers will appear before the <strong>Bema Seat of Christ</strong>, where their works will be evaluated, and rewards will be given. This judgment is for the purpose of reward, not condemnation, <em>"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body."</em> <strong>(2 Corinthians 5:10)</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-significance-of-the-resurrection"><strong>The Significance of the Resurrection</strong></h3>
<p>The resurrection fulfills the promise of eternal life and victory over death. <em>"For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 15:53)</strong>. It is a demonstration of Christ's power over death and a guarantee of the believer's future glorification. Through this event, the saints will experience the fullness of their salvation as they are conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-judgment"><strong>The Judgment</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that <strong>Judgment</strong> is an essential aspect of God's character and His ultimate plan of justice. Scripture reveals that every person will face judgment before God, who judges with perfect righteousness. <em>"For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God…So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God."</em> <strong>(Romans 14:10,12)</strong>. This includes both believers and unbelievers, with distinct judgments that reveal God's justice, holiness, and sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="judgment-for-believers-the-bema-seat-of-christ"><strong>Judgment for Believers: The Bema Seat of Christ</strong></h3>
<p>Believers will appear before the <strong>Bema Seat of Christ</strong> (the Judgment Seat of Christ) to receive rewards for their faithful service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Bema Seat is to evaluate believers' lives and reward them according to their works, <em>"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."</em> <strong>(Ephesians 2:10)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards</strong>: The rewards given at the Bema Seat reflect God’s recognition of the believer’s faithfulness, <em>"Each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work."</em> <strong>(1 Corinthians 3:13)</strong>. Believers are rewarded with crowns and other blessings, <em>"And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."</em> <strong>(1 Peter 5:4)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="judgment-for-unbelievers-the-great-white-throne"><strong>Judgment for Unbelievers: The Great White Throne</strong></h3>
<p>Unbelievers will face final judgment at the <strong>Great White Throne</strong>, where they will be judged for their rejection of Christ and their deeds. This judgment is one of condemnation, resulting in eternal separation from God.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Great White Throne</strong>: At the end of the age, those who have rejected God will stand before Him for judgment. <em>"Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:11)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Book of Life</strong>: Those not found in the Book of Life will face eternal punishment, <em>"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:15)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Final Destination</strong>: Unbelievers will be cast into the <strong>Lake of Fire</strong>, which is the second death, <em>"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</em> <strong>(Matthew 25:46)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-judgment-of-angels"><strong>The Judgment of Angels</strong></h3>
<p>God will also judge angels who rebelled with Satan. <em>"And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day."</em> <strong>(Jude 1:6)</strong>. These fallen angels, along with Satan, will face eternal punishment, <em>"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:10)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-gods-judgment"><strong>The Nature of God’s Judgment</strong></h3>
<p>God’s judgment flows from His perfect holiness and righteousness. He is a holy and just Judge who cannot tolerate sin in His presence, as His nature is pure and blameless. <em>"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor."</em> <strong>(Habakkuk 1:13)</strong>. As a just God, He judges all people according to His perfect standards.</p>
<p><strong>God’s Righteousness:</strong> God’s judgment is based on His unchanging righteousness; His standards are flawless, and His judgments are just. <em>"The Lord is righteous, He loves righteousness; the upright will behold His face."</em> <strong>(Psalm 11:7)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>God’s Holiness:</strong> Because God is holy, He cannot be in the presence of sin or overlook unrighteousness. His holiness demands that He judge sin, upholding His blameless character. <em>"The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He."</em> <strong>(Deuteronomy 32:4)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>God’s Justice:</strong> God's justice ensures that each person is held accountable for their actions. His judgments are fair and unchangeable, offering mercy to those covered by Christ’s atonement, while condemning sin and rebellion in those who reject Him. <em>"For the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for Him."</em> <strong>(Isaiah 30:18)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-judgment-and-eternal-destinies"><strong>The Final Judgment and Eternal Destinies</strong></h3>
<p>The final judgment is the culmination of God’s redemptive plan, where all creation is held accountable before Him. Believers will experience eternal life in the presence of God, while unbelievers face eternal separation from Him.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eternal Life</strong>: Believers are promised eternal life with God in the New Heaven and New Earth, <em>"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain."</em> <strong>(Revelation 21:4)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Separation</strong>: For those who reject God, eternal separation is their end, <em>"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord."</em> <strong>(2 Thessalonians 1:9)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-second-coming-of-the-messiah"><strong>The Second Coming of the Messiah</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that the Second Coming of <strong>Jesus Christ, the Messiah</strong>, will occur at a time when it is not anticipated, as Scripture says, <em>"For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night."</em> <strong>(1 Thessalonians 5:2)</strong>. His return will be visible, physical, and triumphant, just as He ascended. <em>"They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory."</em> <strong>(Matthew 24:30)</strong>. <em>"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be."</em> <strong>(Matthew 24:27)</strong>.</p>
<p>Upon His return, Christ will bring <strong>final judgment</strong> to all nations, gathering them before Him as He sits on His glorious throne. <em>"When the Son of Man comes in His glory... He will sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them one from another."</em> <strong>(Matthew 25:31-32)</strong>. He will establish His eternal kingdom, fulfilling God’s plan of redemption. <em>"The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever."</em> <strong>(Revelation 11:15)</strong>.</p>
<p>At the culmination of this redemptive plan, Christ will defeat all evil, casting Satan and his forces into the Lake of Fire. <em>"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:10)</strong>. The Second Coming of Christ is the blessed hope of all believers, as we eagerly await <em>"the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus."</em> <strong>(Titus 2:13)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="eternity"><strong>Eternity</strong></h3>
<p>I believe that <strong>eternity</strong> is the final state of existence for all souls, where time, as we know it, ceases, and each person experiences a permanent, unchanging destiny. The Scriptures reveal two eternal destinations: eternal life in the presence of God for believers and eternal separation from God for those who reject Him. <em>"And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</em> <strong>(Matthew 25:46)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="eternal-life-with-god"><strong>Eternal Life with God</strong></h3>
<p>For believers, eternity means <strong>everlasting life in the presence of God</strong>. This life is one of unbroken fellowship, worship, and joy, free from sin, suffering, and death. <em>"And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them.'"</em> <strong>(Revelation 21:3)</strong>, and is the fulfillment of God’s promises and the ultimate hope of the Christian faith. <em>"And thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words."</em> <strong>(1 Thessalonians 4:17-18)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The New Heaven and New Earth</strong>: God will create a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells and all things are made new. <em>"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away."</em> <strong>(Revelation 21:1)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Absence of Suffering</strong>: In eternity with God, there will be no more pain, sorrow, or death. <em>"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain."</em> <strong>(Revelation 21:4)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eternal-separation-from-god"><strong>Eternal Separation from God</strong></h3>
<p>For those who reject God, eternity means eternal separation from Him in a place of suffering. This separation is final and irreversible, marking a state of conscious existence apart from God’s goodness and grace. <em>"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power."</em> <strong>(2 Thessalonians 1:9)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Lake of Fire</strong>: Unbelievers face eternity in the Lake of Fire, a place of punishment originally prepared for the devil and his angels. <em>"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."</em> <strong>(Revelation 20:15)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Conscious Punishment</strong>: The suffering of eternal separation is continuous, and the consequences of sin remain without end. <em>"Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched."</em> <strong>(Mark 9:48)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
