<h1 id="john-11-22">John 1:1-2:2</h1>
<h2 id="jesus-christ-son-of-god-eternal-word">Jesus Christ, Son of God, Eternal Word</h2>
<p><strong>John1:1-5</strong>
1. In the beginning of all things was the Word, He was with God, and the Word was God.
2. He was, has been, will always be with God.
3. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing has come into being.
4. Life is in Him, and that life was the Light unto men.
5. The only true Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness of men do not comprehend it.</p>
<h2 id="johns-witness-to-the-true-light">John's Witness to the True Light</h2>
<p><strong>John 1:6-8</strong>
6. There came a man sent, commissioned from God, his name was John. [Mal 3:1]
7. He came as a witness, and testified about the Light, so that all might believe and have faith, not in him, but through him for the Word and True Light.
8. He himself was not the Light, but came to testify and he bore witness about the Light.</p>
<p><strong>John 1:9-13</strong>
9. There was the True Light which, has come into the world enlighten every man, 
10. However He was in the world, and even though the world was made through Him and for Him, the world did not know Him; even though the Light shone through them and revealed their darkness
11. He came to His own people, His chosen people, and yet they did not receive Him.
12. But those that did receive Him, to them He gave them the right to become the children of God, not just them only but to those who believe in His name,
13. who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but born of God.</p>
<h2 id="the-word-was-made-flesh-and-dwelt-among-us">The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us</h2>
<p><strong>John 1:14-18</strong>
14. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt (tabernacled) among us, and we beheld His glory, His glory was revealed, which was the true nature of His as the only begotten of the Father, full of grace the merciful kindness and truth.
15. John testified about Him and proclaimed saying "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me'"
16. For of His richest fullness we have all received, grace upon grace, showing kindness by exerting His holy influence upon the souls of men.
17. For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth has been given through Jesus Christ; redeemer and Messiah.
18. No one has seen God, ever; the only begotten God who is intimately connected with the Father, He has revealed Him.</p>
<h2 id="the-testimony-of-john-a-voice-crying-out-in-the-wilderness">The Testimony of John, a voice crying out in the Wilderness</h2>
<ol>
<li>This is the testimony of John, and when the Jews sent him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</li>
<li>John confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."</li>
<li>They then asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, "I am not." Are you the Prophet?" [Deut 18:15, 18; Mal 4:5] And he answered, "No."</li>
<li>Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"</li>
<li>He said, "I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD' as Isaiah the prophet said."</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-lamb-of-god-who-takes-away-the-sin-of-the-world">The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world</h2>
<ol>
<li>The next day John truly saw Jesus (revealed by the Spirit) coming to him and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</li>
<li>This is He on behalf of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me, though physically I am older than He.'</li>
<li>"I did not recognize Him, even though He is my cousin, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water"</li>
<li>For John testified saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.</li>
<li>"for I say again, I did not recognize Him, but God who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'</li>
<li>"I myself have seen, and can testify that this is the Son of God."</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="jesus-public-ministry-and-the-first-disciples">Jesus' Public Ministry and the First Disciples</h2>
<p><strong>John 1:35-42</strong>
35. Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
36. and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
37. The two disciples heard him speak about Him, and they followed after Jesus.
38. And Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, "What do you seek?" They said to Him, "Teacher, where are You staying?"
39. He said to them, "Come, follow Me and you will see." So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
40. One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
41. He found first his own brother and said to him, "We have found the Messiah, the Christ".
42. He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (translated to Peter).</p>
<h2 id="disciples-philip-and-nathanael">Disciples Philip and Nathanael</h2>
<ol>
<li>The next day He purposely went to Galilee to find a man named Philip. And when Jesus saw him, he said unto him, "Follow Me."</li>
<li>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</li>
<li>Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about - Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</li>
<li>Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."</li>
<li>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"</li>
<li>Nathanael said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</li>
<li>Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel."</li>
<li>Jesus answered and said to him, "Becaus I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</li>
<li>And He said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="jesus-attends-a-wedding-in-cana">Jesus attends a wedding in Cana</h2>
<p><strong>John 2:1-2</strong>
1. On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;
2. and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.</p></div>
