<h1 id="session-2-part-2-the-nature-of-god">Session 2 Part 2: The Nature of God</h1>
<p><strong>God is Spiritual</strong></p>
<p><strong>God is personal:</strong>
- He has intellect
- He has emotions
- He has will
- He has definable attributes</p>
<p><strong>God is Triune</strong></p>
<h2 id="gods-spiritual-nature">God's Spiritual Nature</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 4:24</strong><br />
<em>God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”</em></p>
<p><strong>1 Kings 8:27</strong><br />
<em>“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built!</em></p>
<p><strong>Acts 17:24-25</strong><br />
<em>The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 25nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>God is not made of matter as we are; He is a spiritual being.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="gods-personal-attributes">God's Personal Attributes</h2>
<p><strong>Because God thinks, we know He has intellect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Isaiah 55:8-9</strong><br />
<em>“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,</em><br />
<em>Nor are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord.</em><br />
<em>“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,</em><br />
<em>So are My ways higher than your ways</em><br />
<em>And My thoughts than your thoughts.</em></p>
<p><strong>1 John 3:20</strong><br />
<em>in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In Scripture, we learn that God displays emotions such as..</strong><br />
- <strong>Jealousy</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 34:14</strong><br />
<em>for you shall not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God</em>
- <strong>Anger</strong><br />
<strong>Numbers 11:1</strong><br />
<em>Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the Lord; and when the Lord heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Exodus 4:14</strong><br />
<em>Then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses, and He said, “Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>God has a purpose and displays volition. We say that He has a Will.</strong>
- <strong>10 Commandments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:1-17</strong><br />
<em>“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.</em><br />
<em>[1]“You shall have no other gods before Me.</em><br />
<em>[2]“You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.</em><br />
<em>[3]“You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.</em><br />
<em>[4]“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.</em><br />
<em>[5]“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you.</em><br />
<em>[6]“You shall not murder.</em><br />
<em>[7]“You shall not commit adultery.</em><br />
<em>[8]“You shall not steal.</em><br />
<em>[9]“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</em><br />
<em>[10]“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 14:24</strong><br />
<em>The Lord of hosts has sworn saying, “Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have planned so it will stand,</em></p>

<em>So I do not see him?” declares the Lord.</em><br />
<em>“Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the Lord.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God's power is absolutely limitless, He is <em>Omnipotent</em>. God cannot sin, cannot fail<blockquote>
<p><strong>Genesis 17:1</strong><br />
<em>Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him,</em><br />
<em>“I am God Almighty;</em><br />
<em>Walk before Me, and be blameless.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark 14:36</strong><br />

<p><strong>Revelation 19:6</strong><br />
<em>Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying,
“Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God transcends His universe and exists everywhere at once, He is <em>Omnipresent</em><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalms 139:7-10</strong><br />
<em>Where can I go from Your Spirit?</em><br />
<em>Or where can I flee from Your presence?</em><br />
<em>If I ascend to heaven, You are there;</em><br />
<em>If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.</em><br />
<em>If I take the wings of the dawn,</em><br />
<em>If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,</em>
<em>Even there Your hand will lead me,</em><br />
<em>And Your right hand will lay hold of me.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hebrews 13:8</strong>
<em>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God always keeps His word, and cannot lie, He is <em>True</em><blockquote>
<p><strong>Numbers 23:19</strong>
<em>God is not a man, that He should lie,</em><br />
<em>Nor a son of man, that He should repent;</em><br />
<em>Has He said, and will He not do it?</em><br />
<em>Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalms 146:6</strong>
<em>Who made heaven and earth,</em><br />
<em>The sea and all that is in them;</em><br />
<em>Who keeps faith forever;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 6:18</strong>
<em>so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There is absolutely no fault in God, He is the very definition of <em>Good</em><blockquote>

<em>The lovingkindness of God endures all day long.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<em>And He said to him, “Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God's goodness is the fact that He is sacred, beyond anything, He is <em>Holy</em><blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 15:11</strong>
<em>Who is like You among the gods, O Lord?</em><br />
<em>Who is like You, majestic in holiness,</em><br />
<em>Awesome in praises, working wonders?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<em>For all the nations will come and worship before You,</em><br />
<em>For Your righteous acts have been revealed.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God has no external cause, He is <em>Self-Existent</em><blockquote>

</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 5:26</strong>
<em>For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;</em></p>
<p><strong>Acts 17:24-25</strong>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God is without sin or guilt, and His judgements are always perfect, He is <em>Just</em><blockquote>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>
<em>But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</em></p>

<em>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “But the righteous man shall live by faith.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God is supreme, permanent authority over everything, He is <em>Sovereign</em><blockquote>

<em>Nations have perished from His land.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 6:15</strong>
<em>which He will bring about at the proper time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</em></p>

<em>These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.”</em></p>
