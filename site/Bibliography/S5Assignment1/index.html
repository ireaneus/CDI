<h3 id="ministered-as-a-priest-though-not-a-levite">“ministered as a priest (though not a Levite)”</h3>
<p><strong>O.T. Psalm 110:4</strong>
- <em>The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind,
“You are a priest forever
According to the order of Melchizedek.”</em></p>
<p><strong>N.T. Hebrews 5:1-10; 7:1-28</strong>
- <em>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 2he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness; 3and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself. 4And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.
5So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him,
“You are My Son,
Today I have begotten You”;
6just as He says also in another passage,
“You are a priest forever
According to the order of Melchizedek.”
7In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety. 8Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. 9And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation, 10being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</em>
- <em>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,
“You are a priest forever
According to the order of Melchizedek.”
18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,
“The Lord has sworn
And will not change His mind,
‘You are a priest forever’ ”);
22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.</em></p>

<p><strong>Psalm 102:</strong>
- <em>Prayer of an Afflicted Man for Mercy on Himself and on Zion.
A Prayer of the Afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the Lord.
1Hear my prayer, O Lord!
And let my cry for help come to You.
2Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my distress;
Incline Your ear to me;
In the day when I call answer me quickly.
3For my days have been consumed in smoke,
And my bones have been scorched like a hearth.
4My heart has been smitten like grass and has withered away,
Indeed, I forget to eat my bread.
5Because of the loudness of my groaning
My bones cling to my flesh.
6I resemble a pelican of the wilderness;
I have become like an owl of the waste places.
7I lie awake,
I have become like a lonely bird on a housetop.
8My enemies have reproached me all day long;
Those who deride me have used my name as a curse.
9For I have eaten ashes like bread
And mingled my drink with weeping
10Because of Your indignation and Your wrath,
For You have lifted me up and cast me away.
11My days are like a lengthened shadow,
And I wither away like grass.
12But You, O Lord, abide forever,
And Your name to all generations.
13You will arise and have compassion on Zion;
For it is time to be gracious to her,
For the appointed time has come.
14Surely Your servants find pleasure in her stones
And feel pity for her dust.
15So the nations will fear the name of the Lord
And all the kings of the earth Your glory.
16For the Lord has built up Zion;
He has appeared in His glory.
17He has regarded the prayer of the destitute
And has not despised their prayer.
18This will be written for the generation to come,
That a people yet to be created may praise the Lord.
19For He looked down from His holy height;
From heaven the Lord gazed upon the earth,
20To hear the groaning of the prisoner,
To set free those who were doomed to death,
21That men may tell of the name of the Lord in Zion
And His praise in Jerusalem,
22When the peoples are gathered together,
And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.
23He has weakened my strength in the way;
He has shortened my days.
24I say, “O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days,
Your years are throughout all generations.
25Of old You founded the earth,
And the heavens are the work of Your hands.
26Even they will perish, but You endure;
And all of them will wear out like a garment;
Like clothing You will change them and they will be changed.
27But You are the same,
And Your years will not come to an end.
28The children of Your servants will continue,
And their descendants will be established before You.”</em></p>

Come, see the place where He was lying</em></p></div>
