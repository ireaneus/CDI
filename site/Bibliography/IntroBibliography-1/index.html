<li>Nature’s witness</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Psalm 19:1-4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>The heavens tell of the glory of God; And their expanse declares the work of His hands.</em></li>
<li><em>Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.</em></li>
<li><em>There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard.</em></li>
<li><em>Their line has gone out into all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He has placed a tent for the sun,</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Acts 14:17</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 104:5-9</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>¶He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever.</em></li>
<li><em>You covered it with the deep sea as with a garment; The waters were standing above the mountains.</em></li>
<li><em>They fled from Your rebuke, At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away.</em></li>
<li><em>The mountains rose; the valleys sank down To the place which You established for them.</em></li>
<li><em>You set a boundary so that they will not pass over, So that they will not return to cover the earth.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:4-5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue just as they were from the beginning of creation.”</em></li>
<li><em>For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water,</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Romans 1:19-20</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.</em></li>
<li><em>For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>History's witness</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I Kings 8:56</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to His people Israel in accordance with everything that He promised; not one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Acts 7:2-53</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>And Stephen said, “Listen to me, brothers and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,</em></li>
<li><em>and He said to him, ‘Go from your country and your relatives, and come to the land which I will show you.’ (GEN 12:1)</em></li>
<li><em>Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living.</em></li>
<li>But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, He promised that He would give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child. (GEN 12:7; 13:15)*</li>
<li><em>But God spoke to this effect, that his descendants would be strangers in a land that was not theirs, and they would enslave and mistreat them for four hundred years. (GEN 15:13f)</em></li>
<li><em>‘And whatever nation to which they are enslaved I Myself will judge,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve Me in this place.’ (EXO 3:12)</em></li>
<li><em>And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham fathered Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.</em></li>
<li><em>“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him,</em></li>
<li><em>and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and his entire household.</em></li>
<li><em>“Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction with it, and our fathers could find no food.</em></li>
<li><em>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time.</em></li>
<li><em>And on the second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family was revealed to Pharaoh.</em></li>
<li><em>Then Joseph sent word and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five people in all.</em></li>
<li><em>And Jacob went down to Egypt, and he and our fathers died there.</em></li>
<li><em>And they were brought back from there to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</em></li>
<li><em>“But as the time of the promise which God had assured to Abraham was approaching, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,</em></li>
<li><em>until another king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.</em></li>
<li><em>It was he who shrewdly took advantage of our nation and mistreated our fathers in order that they would abandon their infants in the Nile, so that they would not survive.</em></li>
<li><em>At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful to God. He was nurtured for three months in his father’s home.</em></li>
<li><em>And after he had been put outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son.</em></li>
<li><em>Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was proficient in speaking and action.</em></li>
<li><em>But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his countrymen, the sons of Israel.</em></li>
<li><em>And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended and took vengeance for the oppressed man by fatally striking the Egyptian.</em></li>
<li><em>And he thought that his brothers understood that God was granting them deliverance through him; but they did not understand.</em></li>
<li><em>And on the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting each other, and he tried to reconcile them to peace, by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers, why are you injuring each other?’</em></li>
<li><em>But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us? (EXO 2:14)</em></li>
<li><em>You do not intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’ (EXO 2:14)</em></li>
<li><em>At this remark, Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons. (EXO 2:15,22)</em></li>
<li><em>“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning thorn bush. (EXO 3:1f, ISA 63:9)</em></li>
<li><em>When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, the voice of the Lord came:</em></li>
<li><em>‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses shook with fear and did not dare to look closely. (EXO 3:6)</em></li>
<li><em>But the Lord said to him, ‘Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. (JOSH 5:15)</em></li>
<li><em>I have certainly seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them; and now come, I will send you to Egypt.’ (EXO 3:7f,10)</em></li>
<li><em>“This Moses whom they disowned, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush.</em></li>
<li><em>This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.</em></li>
<li><em>This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your countrymen.’ (DEUT 18:15,18)</em></li>
<li><em>This is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness together with the angel who spoke to him at length on Mount Sinai, and who was with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to you.</em></li>
<li><em>Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him; on the contrary they rejected him and turned back to Egypt in their hearts,</em></li>
<li><em>saying to Aaron, ‘Make us a god who will go before us; for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we do not know what happened to him.’ (EXO 32:1,23)</em></li>
<li><em>At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.</em></li>
<li><em>But God turned away and gave them over to serve the heavenly lights; as it is written in the book of the prophets: ‘You did not offer Me victims and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, did you, house of Israel? (AMOS 5:25)</em></li>
<li><em>You also took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Rompha, the images which you made to worship. I also will deport you beyond Babylon.’ (AMOS 5:26-27)</em></li>
<li><em>“Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen.</em></li>
<li><em>Our fathers in turn received it, and they also brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations that God drove out from our fathers, until the time of David.</em></li>
<li><em>David found favor in God’s sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob.</em></li>
<li><em>But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.</em></li>
<li><em>However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:</em></li>
<li><em>‘Heaven is My throne, And the earth is the footstool of My feet; What kind of house will you build for Me?’ says the Lord, ‘Or what place is there for My rest? (ISA 66:1)</em></li>
<li><em>‘Was it not My hand that made all these things?’ (ISA 66:2)</em></li>
<li><em>“You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did.</em></li>
<li><em>Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, and you have now become betrayers and murderers of Him;</em></li>
<li><em>you who received the Law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it.”</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Acts 17:26-28</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,</em></li>
<li><em>that they would seek God, if perhaps they might feel around for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Conscience's witness</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, without the possibility that mankind will find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Corinthians 3:3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>revealing yourselves, that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Romans 2:14-15</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>For when Gentiles who do not have the Law instinctively perform the requirements of the Law, these, though not having the Law, are a law to themselves,</em></li>
<li><em>in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,</em> </li>
