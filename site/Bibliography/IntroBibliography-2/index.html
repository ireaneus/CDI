</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Pe 1:20-21</strong> 20. <em>But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture becomes a matter of someone’s own interpretation,</em> 21. <em>for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lk 21:33</strong> <em>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.</em></p>

<p><strong>Matt 4:4, 7, 10,</strong> 4. <em>But He answered and said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.’ ”</em> 7. <em>Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written: ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”</em> 10. <em>Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.’ ”</em></p>
<p><strong>Eph 6:10-17</strong> 10. <em>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.</em> 11. <em>Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.</em> 12. <em>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.</em> 13. <em>Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.</em> 14. <em>Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</em> 15. <em>and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace;</em> 16. <em>in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</em> 17. <em>And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</em></p>

<p><strong>2 Pe 1:16-19</strong> 16. <em>For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. 17For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such a declaration as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory: “This is My beloved Son with whom I am well pleased”— 18and we ourselves heard this declaration made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.</em></p>

<p><strong>Jn 8:44</strong> 44. <em>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.

Whenever he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.</em></p>
<p><strong>2 Cor 4:4</strong> 4. <em>in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</em></p>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Tim 2:15</strong> 15. <em>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.</em></p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 1:19</strong> 19. <em>And so we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Heb 2:1-3</strong> 1. <em>For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it. 2For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every violation and act of disobedience received a just punishment, 3how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,</em></p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:16</strong> 16. <em>as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which there are some things that are hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.</em></p>
