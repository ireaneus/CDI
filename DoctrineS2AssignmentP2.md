## God's Spiritual Nature

> **John 4:24**  
> *God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”*

> **1 Kings 8:27**  
> *“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built!*

> **Acts 17:24-25**  
> *The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 25nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;*

**God is not made of matter as we are; He is a spiritual being.**

## God's Personal Attributes
**Because God thinks, we know He has intellect**

> **Isaiah 55:8-9**  
> *“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,*  
> *Nor are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord.*  
> *“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,*  
> *So are My ways higher than your ways*  
> *And My thoughts than your thoughts.*
 
> **1 John 3:20**  
> *in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things.*

**In Scripture, we learn that God displays emotions such as..**  
- **Jealousy**  
> **Exodus 34:14**  
> *for you shall not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God*
- **Anger**  
> **Numbers 11:1**  
> *Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the Lord; and when the Lord heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.*  
> **Exodus 4:14**  
> *Then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses, and He said, “Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.*

**God has a purpose and displays volition. We say that He has a Will.**
- **10 Commandments**
> **Exodus 20:1-17**  
> *“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.*  
> *[1]“You shall have no other gods before Me.*  
> *[2]“You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.*  
> *[3]“You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.*  
> *[4]“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.*  
> *[5]“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you.*  
> *[6]“You shall not murder.*  
> *[7]“You shall not commit adultery.*  
> *[8]“You shall not steal.*  
> *[9]“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.*  
> *[10]“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”*

> **Isaiah 14:24**  
> *The Lord of hosts has sworn saying, “Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have planned so it will stand,*
