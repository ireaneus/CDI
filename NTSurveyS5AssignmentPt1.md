- What problems do they see with the ‘Synoptic Problem’?

#### **The Synoptic Problem**
The "Synoptic Problem" refers to the question of how to explain the similarities and differences among the Synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Scholars observe that these gospels often contain parallel material, sometimes word-for-word, but also include unique content. Theories about their relationships (e.g., which gospel was written first and what sources they used) lead to debates over authorship, composition, and historical reliability.

In Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels essays 3-5 deal with the critics of the gospels and their theories. Each gives answers to these theories. Either working alone or in a group, choose an essay: “Source criticism”, “Form Criticism”, or “Redaction Criticism” to read and then answer these questions:

Your formatting and phrasing are clear and well-structured. If you're satisfied with this approach, it works perfectly for providing concise yet precise definitions. Here's a minor refinement for flow:

- **What is source, form, or redaction criticism?**  
The definition of **source criticism** is at the bottom of page 274: *"This method investigates the written sources that gospel writers may have used, such as the theory that Mark or a hypothetical 'Q' document served as sources for Matthew and Luke."*  
The definition of **form criticism** is at the bottom of page 280: *"This approach examines the oral traditions behind the gospel accounts, classifying them into literary forms (e.g., parables, miracles) to study their historical and cultural origins."*  
The definition of **redaction criticism** is in the second paragraph of page 287: *"This method analyzes how gospel writers edited and arranged their material to emphasize specific theological themes or address the needs of their audiences."*

- How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels?

1. **Source Criticism**: It relies on speculative sources like "Q" without direct evidence and overlooks the role of oral tradition.  
2. **Form Criticism**: It assumes the gospel material is fragmented and dismisses the reliability of oral tradition in preserving accurate history.  
3. **Redaction Criticism**: It exaggerates the editorial role of gospel writers, undermining their historical reliability.  

- What is the answer to this type of criticism?

1. **Source Criticism**: The gospels rely on trustworthy oral tradition and eyewitness testimony, guided by divine inspiration.  
2. **Form Criticism**: The gospels are unified, reliable narratives, not fragmented oral traditions.  
3. **Redaction Criticism**: The gospel writers emphasized theology while preserving historical truth.

Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament pp. 40-43 beginning with *“A
Comparison of the Four Gospels.”*  

- What is the synoptic problem, the proposed solutions and the historic view of the church?

The Synoptic Problem explores the similarities and differences between Matthew, Mark, and Luke, with proposed solutions like Markan priority (Mark as the first gospel) and the hypothetical "Q" source, while the historic church view emphasizes the gospels' divine inspiration and reliance on eyewitness testimony.

- Write an “I believe” statement that begins,
*“I believe that the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, though very similar in content and structure, are divinely inspired. They were written at the proper time to address the specific needs of their respective audiences, offering edification and hope to persecuted saints. God's providence ensured their unique yet harmonious accounts, demonstrating His intentional design to deliver the Living Word to generations of believers. These gospels provide encouragement, hope, and the foundation for salvation, affirming that "faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" (Romans 10:17).”*

Matthew 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45 and Luke 5:12-16 are considered to be an example of the same event in each of the synoptic gospels. Read Thomas and Gundry, *A Harmony of the Gospels p. 53.*  

- Note the similarities between them. What differences can you find?

- Read the context before and after and discuss the circumstances.
- What does the way Jesus deals with lepers tell us about Jesus’ concerns of those of the
culture in which He lived?

- Why would touching be significant to each of the authors given what you know about
them? Why do you think that Mark gives more detail?
