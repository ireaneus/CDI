- What problems do they see with the ‘Synoptic Problem’?

In Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels essays 3-5 deal with the critics of
the gospels and their theories. Each gives answers to these theories. Either working
alone or in a group, choose an essay: “Source criticism”, “Form Criticism”, or
“Redaction Criticism” to read and then answer these questions:

- What is source, form or redaction criticism?

- How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels?

- What is the answer to this type of criticism?

| | Definition | Weaknesses | Answer |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|
| Source Criticism | | | |
| Form Criticism | | | |
| Redaction Criticism | | | |

Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament pp. 40-43 beginning with *“A
Comparison of the Four Gospels.”*  

- What is the synoptic problem, the proposed solutions and the historic view of the
church?

- Write an “I believe” statement that begins, “I believe that the gospels of Matthew, Mark
and Luke, though very similar in content and structure, are _____________________.”  

Matthew 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45 and Luke 5:12-16 are considered to be an example of the
same event in each of the synoptic gospels. Read Thomas and Gundry, *A Harmony of
the Gospels p. 53.*  

- Note the similarities between them. What differences can you find?

- Read the context before and after and discuss the circumstances.
- What does the way Jesus deals with lepers tell us about Jesus’ concerns of those of the
culture in which He lived?

- Why would touching be significant to each of the authors given what you know about
them? Why do you think that Mark gives more detail?
