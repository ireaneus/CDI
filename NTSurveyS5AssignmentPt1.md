- What problems do they see with the ‘Synoptic Problem’?

In Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels essays 3-5 deal with the critics of
the gospels and their theories. Each gives answers to these theories. Either working
alone or in a group, choose an essay: “Source criticism”, “Form Criticism”, or
“Redaction Criticism” to read and then answer these questions:

- What is source, form or redaction criticism?

- How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels?

- What is the answer to this type of criticism?
