# The Bible and Divine Revelation
**God is the Incomprehensible One**

God is an infinite being, we are finite humans that cannot understand perfectly the Infinite God.
-*Job 11:7 - “Can you discover the depths of God?*
*Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?"*

## Modes of Revelation: General and Special
### General Revelation
**Through Nature**
> **Psalms 19:1-6** *1The heavens are telling of the glory of God;
And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.
2Day to day pours forth speech,
And night to night reveals knowledge.
3There is no speech, nor are there words;
Their voice is not heard.
4Their line has gone out through all the earth,
And their utterances to the end of the world.
In them He has placed a tent for the sun,
5Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber;
It rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
6Its rising is from one end of the heavens,
And its circuit to the other end of them;
And there is nothing hidden from its heat.*
> Concept of creation


> **Isaiah 40:12,14,26** *12Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,
And marked off the heavens by the span,
And calculated the dust of the earth by the measure,
And weighed the mountains in a balance
And the hills in a pair of scales?*
> *14With whom did He consult and who gave Him understanding?
And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge
And informed Him of the way of understanding?*
> *26Lift up your eyes on high
And see who has created these stars,
The One who leads forth their host by number,
He calls them all by name;
Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power,
Not one of them is missing.*
> Reveals Glory of God, Individuality

> **Acts 14:14-17** *14But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out 15and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. 16In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways; 17and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”*
> Goodness of God

> **Romans 1:19-20** *19because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. 20For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.*
> Power and Divinity of God

**Through Providence**
> **Job 38:22-23** *22Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,
Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
23Which I have reserved for the time of distress,
For the day of war and battle?*
> Germans were stopped with the snows of Russia, Napoleon was stopped the same way

> **Psalms 75:6-7** *6For not from the east, nor from the west,
Nor from the desert comes exaltation;
7But God is the Judge;
He puts down one and exalts another.*
> God's Providence raised Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, Saul, David, Nebochednezzer

> **Acts 17:26** *26and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,*
> Boundaries, and borders of nations are set

> **Deut 32:8-9** *8When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
When He separated the sons of man,
He set the boundaries of the peoples
According to the number of the sons of Israel.
9For the Lord’s portion is His people;
Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.*
> History of the nation of Isreal

> **Romans 8:28** *28And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.*

**Through Preservation**
> **Acts 17:28** *28for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children.’*
> Human Preservation

> **Col 1:17** *17He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.*
> **Heb 1:3** *3And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,*
> Universal Preservation.  Atomic glue.  Atoms are in nature explosive, however God is holding them together

**Through Conscience**
> **Romans 2:14-15** *14For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,*

#### The Limitation of General Revelation - Salvation and Condemnation
**Regarding Salvation**
> **Acts 17:23** *23For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.*
> General Revelation offers limited knowledge

> **Ephesians 3:8-9** *8To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, 9and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;*
> Hidden to the minds of men
