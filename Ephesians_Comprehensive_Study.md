## The Calling of the Church vs. 1:1-3:21

### **Ephesians Chapter 1**  
**_In Chapter 1, Paul_** praises God for His redemptive work, highlighting the spiritual blessings believers have in Christ, including adoption, redemption, and the sealing of the Holy Spirit (*vv. 1–14*). He prays that they may grow in wisdom, understanding the hope of their calling, the riches of their inheritance, and the greatness of God’s power toward them (*vv. 15–23*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the exalted head over all things, seated at God’s right hand* (*vv. 20–23*), **_Believers should_** *praise God for His grace, trust in Christ’s redemption, and seek wisdom to know Him more* (*vv. 3, 7, 17–18*).

### **Ephesians Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Paul_** explains that believers were once dead in sin but are now made alive in Christ by God’s grace, not by works (*vv. 1–10*). He emphasizes that Jew and Gentile are reconciled into one body through Christ, breaking down the dividing wall of hostility (*vv. 11–22*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the one who brings life, peace, and unity through His grace* (*vv. 5, 14–16*), **_Believers should_** *live as God’s workmanship, created for good works, and walk in unity as fellow citizens of God’s household* (*vv. 10, 19*).

### **Ephesians Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Paul_** explains his role as a steward of the mystery that Gentiles are now fellow heirs in Christ (*vv. 1–13*). He prays for believers to be strengthened with power, rooted in love, and filled with all the fullness of God (*vv. 14–21*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the revealed mystery through whom all believers have access to God* (*vv. 3–6, 12*), **_Believers should_** *grasp the depth of Christ’s love and be strengthened by His Spirit* (*vv. 16–19*).

## The Conduct of the Church (vs. 4:1-6:20)

### **Ephesians Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Paul_** urges believers to walk in unity, using their spiritual gifts to build up the body of Christ (*vv. 1–16*). He calls them to put off their old sinful nature and live in righteousness, holiness, and truth (*vv. 17–32*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the head of the body who equips believers for maturity and unity* (*vv. 15–16*), **_Believers should_** *live in humility, put off the old self, and speak the truth in love* (*vv. 2, 22–25*).

### **Ephesians Chapter 5**  
**_In Chapter 5, Paul_** calls believers to imitate God by walking in love, light, and wisdom, avoiding sin and being filled with the Spirit (*vv. 1–21*). He teaches that marriage reflects Christ’s relationship with the church, where husbands are to love their wives as Christ loves the church and wives are to submit to their husbands as to the Lord (*vv. 22–33*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the loving bridegroom who gave Himself for the church* (*vv. 25–27*), **_Believers should_** *walk in love, live in purity, and submit to one another out of reverence for Christ* (*vv. 2, 8, 21*).

### **Ephesians Chapter 6**  
**_In Chapter 6, Paul_** gives instructions for children, parents, slaves, and masters on how to live in obedience and integrity (*vv. 1–9*). He calls believers to put on the full armor of God to stand against spiritual warfare (*vv. 10–20*). He concludes with final greetings and a blessing of peace, love, and grace (*vv. 21–24*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the victorious Lord who empowers believers to stand firm* (*vv. 10–11*), **_Believers should_** *obey God in their relationships, stand firm in spiritual battles, and pray at all times* (*vv. 1, 13, 18*).
