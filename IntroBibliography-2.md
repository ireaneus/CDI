## The Bible
The Bible was written by a diversity of 40 different authors over a period of 1,500 years,
in a variety of locations. However, the Bible is uniquely one book, with one voice,
consisting of 66 different books.
Its authors came from all walks of life. Some were kings, shepherds, warriors, fishermen,
even a Gentile doctor and a tax collector.

### The Bible is:
1. The Revelation of God

> **1 Sam 3:21** *And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh, because the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord.*

> **2 Tim 3:15** *and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.*

> **Rom 16:25-26** 25. *Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,* 26. *but now has been disclosed, and through the Scriptures of the prophets, in accordance with the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith;*

2. Supernaturally Given & Preserved

> **2 Pe 1:20-21** 20. *But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture becomes a matter of someone’s own interpretation,* 21. *for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.*

> **Lk 21:33** *Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.*
 
> **1 Pe 1:25** *But the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word which was preached to you.*

3. Alive and Life Giving
 
> **Heb 4:12** For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

> **1 Pe 1:23** *for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.*

4. A Balm and a Weapon

> **Prov 4:20-22** *¶My son, pay attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. 21They are not to escape from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart. 22For they are life to those who find them, And healing to all their body.

> **Matt 4:4, 7, 10,** 4. *But He answered and said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.’ ”* 7. *Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written: ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”* 10. *Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.’ ”*

> **Eph 6:10-17** 10. *Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.* 11. *Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.* 12. *For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.* 13. *Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.* 14. *Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,* 15. *and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace;* 16. *in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.* 17. *And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.*
