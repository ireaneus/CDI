When interpreting the Bible, particularly prophetic passages, various views have developed over time. Each view approaches the fulfillment and timeline of biblical prophecy differently. Below are some of the major perspectives:

### 1. **Preterist View**
   - **Definition**: The Preterist view holds that most or all of the Bible’s prophecies, especially those in the Book of Revelation and the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24), were fulfilled in the first century, particularly with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.
   - **Key Beliefs**:
     - Prophecies such as the coming of the Son of Man, tribulation, and the end times primarily refer to events in ancient history.
     - The "end of the world" or "end of the age" refers to the end of the Jewish temple system, not the literal end of the world.
   - **Variations**:
     - **Partial Preterism**: Some prophecies were fulfilled in the first century, but others (like the Second Coming) are still future.
     - **Full Preterism**: All prophecies were fulfilled by the end of the first century.

### 2. **Historicist View**
   - **Definition**: The Historicist view interprets biblical prophecy as an unfolding series of events throughout history, from the time of the writing of the Bible to the end of the world.
   - **Key Beliefs**:
     - Prophecies represent major historical events such as the rise of the Roman Empire, the Reformation, and even modern-day events.
     - The Book of Revelation is seen as a prophetic timeline that spans from the early church to the Second Coming of Christ.
   - **Commonly Held By**: Early Protestant reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin interpreted Revelation in this manner, seeing the papacy as the Antichrist figure.

### 3. **Futurist View**
   - **Definition**: The Futurist view holds that most of the events described in biblical prophecy, particularly in Revelation and Daniel, have not yet occurred and will take place in the future.
   - **Key Beliefs**:
     - The prophecies describe literal future events, such as the rise of the Antichrist, a seven-year tribulation, and Christ’s Second Coming.
     - The events of the end times will happen in a short, catastrophic period rather than over a long period of history.
   - **Commonly Held By**: Many Evangelical Christians, especially those who adhere to Dispensationalism, which divides history into distinct periods or "dispensations."

### 4. **Idealist (or Symbolic) View**
   - **Definition**: The Idealist view interprets the Bible’s prophecies, especially those in Revelation, as symbolic representations of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, rather than specific historical events.
   - **Key Beliefs**:
     - The events in the Bible symbolize the spiritual battle between Christ and Satan that occurs throughout all of human history.
     - The focus is on timeless moral and theological lessons rather than specific prophetic fulfillments.
   - **Commonly Held By**: Some Christian theologians and scholars who emphasize a spiritual or allegorical reading of prophecy.

### 5. **Dispensationalist View**
   - **Definition**: Dispensationalism is a specific form of Futurism that divides human history into different periods or "dispensations" in which God deals with humanity in distinct ways.
   - **Key Beliefs**:
     - Prophecy is largely futuristic and includes events such as the Rapture, a seven-year tribulation, the return of Christ, and the establishment of a literal thousand-year reign (the Millennium).
     - Distinguishes between God’s plan for Israel and the church, seeing the church age as a temporary interruption in God’s plan for Israel.
   - **Commonly Held By**: Many American Evangelicals and proponents of the "Left Behind" series of books.

### 6. **Covenant Theology View**
   - **Definition**: Covenant theology views biblical history as governed by covenants between God and humanity, rather than distinct dispensations.
   - **Key Beliefs**:
     - Biblical prophecy should be interpreted in light of the overarching covenantal relationship between God and His people.
     - The church has replaced Israel in God's plan, and thus many prophecies about Israel are fulfilled in the church.
     - Prophecy is often seen as either preterist or idealist in nature, focusing on spiritual fulfillment rather than specific future events.
   - **Commonly Held By**: Reformed and Presbyterian traditions.
