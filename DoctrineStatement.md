# Doctrinal Statement
**What I believe**


### Scripture
"I believe in the 66 books that make up the complete canon of scripture known as the Bible. They are the divinely inspired, infallible, inerrant, and immutable Word of God. God preordained the writers, their timing in history, and their personal experiences to bring their unique perspective and style. God's sovereign hand ensured that their words convey His message with meticulous accuracy. The Bible is the living word, the authoritative source for faith and practice, it is sufficient for teaching, correcting, and equipping believers for righteous living."
- **Key Scriptures**: 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Revelation 22:18-19; Deuteronomy 4:2; Matthew 5:18

### The Nature of God
We believe in One God, who exists eternally in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are distinct but co-equal in essence, nature, and attributes. The three persons of the Godhead share the same divine nature and operate in perfect unity, without division or separation. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, yet there is only one God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14

### God the Father
God the Father is the first person of the Trinity, the eternal and sovereign Creator of the universe. He is the source of all things and the one who sustains all creation by His power. The Father is both transcendent, above all creation, and immanent, actively involved in the world and with His people.
- **Key Scriptures**: Genesis 1:1; John 3:16; Ephesians 1:3-5

### **God the Son (Jesus Christ)**
Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, is the second person of the Trinity. Through His death and resurrection, He accomplished the redemption of humanity. He is the only mediator between God and man.
- **Key Scriptures**: John 1:1, 14; Philippians 2:6-8; 1 Timothy 2:5

---

### **God the Holy Spirit**
The Holy Spirit indwells believers, guiding, sanctifying, and empowering them for service. He convicts the world of sin and leads believers into all truth.
- **Key Scriptures**: John 14:16-17; Acts 1:8; Romans 8:9

---

### **Salvation**
Salvation is a gift of **God's grace** through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**. It is not based on human works but on the redemptive work of Christ. Believers are justified by faith and adopted as children of God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:23-24; John 3:16

### **The Five Solas**
We affirm the **Five Solas** of the Reformation:
- **Sola Scriptura** (Scripture Alone): The Bible is the ultimate authority.
- **Solus Christus** (Christ Alone): Salvation is through Christ alone.
- **Sola Gratia** (Grace Alone): Salvation is a gift of grace.
- **Sola Fide** (Faith Alone): We are justified by faith alone.
- **Soli Deo Gloria** (To the Glory of God Alone): All things exist for God's glory.
- **Key Scriptures**: Romans 5:1; 1 Corinthians 10:31; Ephesians 2:8-9

### **The Chief End of Man**
We believe that the **chief end of man** is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. Our ultimate purpose is found in worshiping and serving God.
- **Key Scriptures**: 1 Corinthians 10:31; Psalm 73:25-26; Isaiah 43:7
