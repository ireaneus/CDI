## Session 3 Part 1 - The Gospel of Mark
**Exercise Assignment pp. 74**

| Verse | Observation |
| ------ | ---------| 
| Mark 14:51 *A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they seized him. 52But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.* | *This story is not mentioned anywhere else in the gospel and seems obvious that the writer John Mark was the young man.* |
| Acts 12:12ff *And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.* | *Common meeting place apparently she was well to do.  John Mark probably grew up in a home with a God fearing mother* |
| Col 4:10 *Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas’s cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him);* | *Mark was well known in the Church community with a home church and Barnabas's cousin, Paul had high regards for him, and he was a friend of Peter* |
| Philemon 24 *Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 24as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.* | *To be mentioned in a list from Paul by name and your name recorded in the Bible. A humble honor* |
| Acts 13:5 & 15:37-39 *When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.* *Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. 38But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. 39And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.* | *Then to be rebuked by Paul, because he was lazy?* |
| 2 Tim. 4:11 *Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.* | *Interesting that Mark is now useful to Paul at this time, back in Acts he was not* |
| 1 Pet 5:13 *She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. * | *Peter considers Mark his son in the faith* |
| Acts 13:13 *Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.* | *John Mark was a helper in 8 verses before, now he is going back to Jerusalem, so 2 chapters later, Paul must have rebuked Mark about going back to Jerusalem. He probably missed his mother, it sounds like this may have been his first mission trip?* |



#### How would you describe Mark’s character having read Mark 14:51, Acts 12:12ff, Col.4:10 & Philemon 24, Acts 13:5 & 15:37–39, 2 Tim. 4:11, 1 Peter 5:13, Acts 13:3?
*"Initially marked by fear and unreliability, he matures into a faithful and valued servant of Christ. His story demonstrates the importance of mentorship (from Barnabas and Peter). Mark’s eventual role as the author of the Gospel of Mark highlights God’s ability to use imperfect people for His purposes."*

**Read *Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels pp. 36-37, 50-51, 95-96*.**
1. What kinds of connections are there between Matthew, Mark and Luke when they cover the same material?  
*"The Synoptic Gospels—Matthew, Mark, and Luke—share significant material, including major events like Jesus’ baptism, miracles, teachings, and the Passion narrative. They often follow a similar chronological flow, emphasizing themes such as the proclamation of God’s kingdom and Jesus’ role as Messiah. Many passages appear in all three Gospels with parallel wording and structure, likely reflecting shared sources like Mark or the hypothetical "Q" document. This commonality provides a cohesive narrative of Jesus’ ministry while retaining unique nuances."*  

2. What are some of the differences between them?
*"Despite their connections, the Gospels differ in emphasis, audience focus, and narrative details. Matthew addresses a Jewish audience, emphasizing Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, while Luke, written for Gentiles, highlights Jesus’ compassion and universal mission. Mark is action-oriented, focusing on Jesus’ deeds with vivid, direct language. Unique material also sets them apart—Matthew includes the Sermon on the Mount, Luke presents parables like the Good Samaritan, and Mark provides concise yet descriptive accounts. These differences complement each other, offering diverse perspectives on the same events."*

3. What conclusions could you draw about Mark’s writing from this comparison?  
*"In summary, Mark’s gospel stands out for its brevity, vividness, and emphasis on Jesus’ actions and servanthood, serving as both a compelling standalone narrative"*

**Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament pp. 89 - 90 and read “Place and Date of Mark.”**
1. What is the difference between composition, publication, and circulation of a book?  
*"In the case of Mark’s gospel, its composition likely occurred in Rome under Peter’s influence, publication involved its initial distribution to Roman Christians, and its circulation spread it to churches across the Roman Empire."*

2. How would that affect the dating of the Gospel According to Mark?
