### 2 Thessalonians Chapters Summary

**In 2 Thessalonians, Paul** commends the Thessalonians for their faith amidst persecution and assures them that God will bring justice and relief at Christ’s return (*vs. 1:1-12*). He clarifies that the Day of the Lord has not yet come, as the rebellion and the man of lawlessness must be revealed first (*vs. 2:1-12*). **Christ is presented as** the righteous judge who will destroy the lawless one and reward the faithful with eternal glory (*vs. 1:10, 2:8*). **Believers should** stand firm in the gospel, pray diligently, avoid idleness, and persist in doing good while awaiting the Lord’s return (*vs. 2:15, 3:1-13*).
