## **1 Corinthians**  
### I. Introduction vs. 1:1-9
### II. Divisions in the Church vs. 1:10-4:21
**_In Chapter 1, Paul_** greets the Corinthian church, expressing gratitude for the grace of God given to them in Christ Jesus and addressing divisions among them (*vs. 1-13*). He emphasizes that the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but the power of God to those being saved (*vs. 18*), and highlights God’s wisdom in choosing the foolish and weak to shame the wise and strong (*vs. 27-29*). **_Christ is presented as_** the power and wisdom of God, who unites believers and sanctifies them (*vs. 24, 30*). **_Believers should_** strive for unity in the church (*vs. 10*), boast only in the Lord (*vs. 31*), and live as those called to fellowship with Christ (*vs. 9*).

**_In Chapter 2, Paul_** explains that he came to the Corinthians not with eloquence or worldly wisdom, but proclaiming Jesus Christ and Him crucified (*vs. 1-5*). He contrasts the wisdom of this age with the wisdom of God, revealed through the Spirit, and declares that *“the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him”* (*vs. 14*). **_Christ is presented as_** the crucified Savior, through whom God’s wisdom and mystery are revealed to believers (*vs. 7-8*). **_Believers should_** rely on the Spirit for understanding (*vs. 10*), avoid boasting in human wisdom, and embrace the mind of Christ (*vs. 16*).

**_In Chapter 3, Paul_** addresses the Corinthians' divisions and reminds them that believers are God’s field and building, with Christ as the only foundation (*vs. 6-11*). He warns that each one’s works will be tested by fire: *“gold, silver, and precious stones”* will endure, but *“wood, hay, and straw”* will be burned up, revealing the quality of their labor (*vs. 12-15*). **_Christ is presented as_** the foundation upon which all spiritual work must be built to have lasting, eternal value (*vs. 11*). **_Believers should_** build wisely, recognizing that they are the temple of God where the Holy Spirit dwells (*vs. 16-17*), and live in a way that reflects God’s holiness.

**_In Chapter 4, Paul_** emphasizes that apostles and ministers of Christ are stewards of the mysteries of God, and their primary responsibility is to be faithful (*vs. 1-2*). He warns against judging prematurely, reminding the Corinthians that *“each one’s praise will come to him from God”* when the Lord returns (*vs. 5*). **_Christ is presented as_** the Lord who will bring to light what is hidden and judge the hearts of all (*vs. 5*). **_Believers should_** refrain from pride and boasting in human leaders (*vs. 6*), imitate the humility of Christ’s servants (*vs. 16*), and live as faithful stewards accountable to God.

### III. Sins of the Church vs. 5:1-6:20
**_In Chapter 5, Paul_** confronts the church for tolerating sexual immorality, specifically a case of incest, and calls for the removal of the offender from the community (*vs. 1-2*). He emphasizes that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, urging the Corinthians to remove sin from their midst to be a new, unleavened batch, as Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed (*vs. 6-8*). **_Christ is presented as_** the Passover Lamb whose sacrifice calls believers to holiness and purity (*vs. 7*). **_Believers should_** mourn over sin, purge evil from among them (*vs. 2, 13*), and live as a sanctified community in sincerity and truth (*vs. 8*).

**_In Chapter 6, Paul_** rebukes the Corinthians for settling disputes in secular courts and reminds them that believers, sanctified and justified in Christ, are called to judge with godly wisdom (*vv. 1–6, 11*). He warns against sins like sexual immorality and idolatry, emphasizing that their bodies, as temples of the Holy Spirit, must glorify God, for they were bought with a price (*vv. 9–20*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the one who justifies and sanctifies believers through His name* (*v. 11*), **_Believers should_** *flee from sexual immorality* and *glorify God in their bodies* (*vv. 18–20*).

### IV. Problems of the Church vs. 7:1-15:58
**_In Chapter 7, Paul_** addresses questions about marriage, singleness, and divorce, emphasizing that each person should live according to the calling they have received from God (*vv. 1, 17*). He teaches that marriage is a safeguard against immorality, but those who are single can devote themselves more fully to the Lord (*vv. 2, 32–35*). Paul allows for divorce only in specific cases and encourages believers to remain in their current circumstances, whether married, single, or enslaved, as they serve the Lord (*vv. 10–24*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the Lord who calls each believer to live faithfully in their assigned circumstances* (*vv. 17, 24*), **_Believers should_** *honor God in their marital and personal relationships* and *remain faithful to the Lord’s calling in their lives* (*vv. 17, 35*).

**_In Chapter 8, Paul_** discusses the issue of eating food sacrificed to idols, emphasizing that while knowledge can lead to freedom, love should guide believers' actions to avoid causing others to stumble (*vv. 1–3, 9*). He explains that idols have no real existence and that there is only one God, yet some believers with weaker consciences may still view such practices as sinful (*vv. 4–7*). Paul urges the Corinthians to prioritize the spiritual well-being of others over their own rights, avoiding behavior that might lead a weaker brother or sister into sin (*vv. 9–13*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the one through whom all things exist and who strengthens believers to live in love* (*v. 6*), **_Believers should_** *act in love, building up others and avoiding actions that harm their faith* (*vv. 1, 9, 13*).

**_In Chapter 9, Paul_** defends his rights as an apostle, explaining that while he has the right to financial support, he willingly forgoes it to avoid hindering the gospel (*vv. 1–15*). He emphasizes his commitment to preaching the gospel free of charge and becoming all things to all people to save some (*vv. 16–23*). Paul likens the Christian life to a race, urging believers to exercise self-discipline and strive for an imperishable crown (*vv. 24–27*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the source of the gospel and the ultimate goal of faithful service* (*vv. 16–23*), **_Believers should_** *exercise self-control, endure for the sake of the gospel, and run their race to obtain the eternal prize* (*vv. 24–27*).

**_In Chapter 10, Paul_** warns the Corinthians against idolatry and overconfidence, using Israel's wilderness experiences as examples of disobedience and God's judgment (*vv. 1–11*). He urges them to flee from idolatry and reminds them that they cannot partake of both the Lord’s table and the table of demons (*vv. 14–22*). Paul emphasizes that all actions should be done for God’s glory and for the benefit of others, avoiding behavior that might cause others to stumble (*vv. 23–33*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the spiritual Rock who sustains His people* (*v. 4*), **_Believers should_** *flee idolatry, seek God’s glory in all things, and act with consideration for the conscience of others* (*vv. 14, 31–32*).

**_In Chapter 11, Paul_** addresses issues of proper conduct in worship, emphasizing the importance of headship and orderly appearance during prayer and prophecy (*vv. 2–16*). He also rebukes the Corinthians for their improper **observance of the Lord’s Supper**, urging them to partake in a worthy manner, recognizing the body of Christ, and examining themselves to avoid judgment (*vv. 17–34*). **_Christ is presented as_** *the head of every believer and the one who instituted the Lord’s Supper to proclaim His death until He comes* (*vv. 3, 23–26*), **_Believers should_** *honor Christ’s authority, participate in the Lord’s Supper reverently, and examine themselves before partaking* (*vv. 28–31*).
