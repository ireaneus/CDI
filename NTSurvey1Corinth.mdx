### **1 Corinthians**  
#### I. Introduction vs. 1:1-9
#### II. Divisions in the Church vs. 1:10-4:21
**_In Chapter 1, Paul_** greets the Corinthian church, expressing gratitude for the grace of God given to them in Christ Jesus and addressing divisions among them (*vs. 1-13*). He emphasizes that the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but the power of God to those being saved (*vs. 18*), and highlights God’s wisdom in choosing the foolish and weak to shame the wise and strong (*vs. 27-29*). **_Christ is presented as_** the power and wisdom of God, who unites believers and sanctifies them (*vs. 24, 30*). **_Believers should_** strive for unity in the church (*vs. 10*), boast only in the Lord (*vs. 31*), and live as those called to fellowship with Christ (*vs. 9*).

**_In Chapter 2, Paul_** explains that he came to the Corinthians not with eloquence or worldly wisdom, but proclaiming Jesus Christ and Him crucified (*vs. 1-5*). He contrasts the wisdom of this age with the wisdom of God, revealed through the Spirit, and declares that *“the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him”* (*vs. 14*). **_Christ is presented as_** the crucified Savior, through whom God’s wisdom and mystery are revealed to believers (*vs. 7-8*). **_Believers should_** rely on the Spirit for understanding (*vs. 10*), avoid boasting in human wisdom, and embrace the mind of Christ (*vs. 16*).

**_In Chapter 3, Paul_** addresses the Corinthians' divisions and reminds them that believers are God’s field and building, with Christ as the only foundation (*vs. 6-11*). He warns that each one’s works will be tested by fire: *“gold, silver, and precious stones”* will endure, but *“wood, hay, and straw”* will be burned up, revealing the quality of their labor (*vs. 12-15*). **_Christ is presented as_** the foundation upon which all spiritual work must be built to have lasting, eternal value (*vs. 11*). **_Believers should_** build wisely, recognizing that they are the temple of God where the Holy Spirit dwells (*vs. 16-17*), and live in a way that reflects God’s holiness.
