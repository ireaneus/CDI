# Personal Statement of Faith


## **The Chief End of Man**

I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. As Scripture declares, *"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God"* (1 Corinthians 10:31). God has designed humanity to find true satisfaction in Him alone, for *"He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good"* (Psalm 107:9). In God’s presence, we find *"fullness of joy; in His right hand there are pleasures forever"* (Psalm 16:11).

God's Word teaches that life’s ultimate purpose is to fear Him and obey His commandments: *"The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person"* (Ecclesiastes 12:13). Our hearts are meant to desire God above all else, as the psalmist proclaims: *"Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever"* (Psalm 73:25-26).

Man’s chief purpose is not only to glorify God but to enjoy Him forever, finding eternal joy and satisfaction in His presence and walking in obedience to His commands

## The Bible
- *"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work." (2 Timothy 3:16-17)*
- *"But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." (2 Peter 1:20-21)*
- *"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished." (Matthew 5:18)*
- *"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." (John 17:17)*
- *"God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day." (Genesis 1:31)*

The Bible, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is God’s written revelation to mankind. It is inspired by the Holy Spirit, fully inerrant, infallible, and immutable in its original form, providing the ultimate and authoritative rule of faith and practice.

The Scriptures are to be interpreted literally and contextually, guided by the Holy Spirit. The opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days, and all Scripture is to be understood in light of its historical and grammatical context. There may be many applications of a passage, but its true interpretation is singular, given by God and discerned through careful study.

## **The Nature of God**
- *"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God." (Psalm 90:2)*  
- *"I am the Lord, and I do not change." (Malachi 3:6)*  
- *"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all." (Psalm 103:19)*  
- *"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory." (Isaiah 6:3)*

God is eternal, infinite, and unchanging. He exists as one essence in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, possessing all power, knowledge, and authority. God is perfectly holy, just, and righteous, sovereign over all creation, and the source of all truth and goodness. He is self-existent and reveals Himself through His Word, His works in history, and ultimately in Jesus Christ.

### **Key Attributes of God**:
- **Eternal**: *"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God." (Psalm 90:2)*  
- **Infinite**: *"Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" (Jeremiah 23:24)*  
- **Immutable**: *"For I, the Lord, do not change." (Malachi 3:6)*  
- **Omnipotent**: *"I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted." (Job 42:2)*  
- **Omnipresent**: *"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?" (Psalm 139:7-10)*  
- **Omniscient**: *"I am God, and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning." (Isaiah 46:9-10)*  
- **Holy**: *"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory." (Isaiah 6:3)*  
- **Just**: *"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are just." (Deuteronomy 32:4)*  
- **Good**: *"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!" (Psalm 34:8)*  
- **Sovereign**: *"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all." (Psalm 103:19)*  
- **Self-existent**: *"I AM WHO I AM." (Exodus 3:14)*


## The Nature of God: The Trinity
- *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!" (Deuteronomy 6:4)*  
- *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)*  
- *"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one." (1 John 5:7)*  
- *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all." (2 Corinthians 13:14)*

There is only one God who exists eternally in three distinct persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each is perfectly holy, deserving of worship, and worthy of all glory and honor. In the heavenly vision of Revelation, God is praised as "Holy, Holy, Holy," a threefold proclamation that reflects the holiness of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Though distinct in person, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are united in their divine essence and nature. They are co-equal in their attributes of holiness, justice, and mercy, revealing the fullness of God's perfect character.

### **Scriptural Basis for the Trinity**:
- **One God**: *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!" (Deuteronomy 6:4)*  
- **Three Persons**: *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)*  
- **Unity in Essence**: *"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one." (1 John 5:7)*  
- **Distinct Persons in Relationship**: *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all." (2 Corinthians 13:14)*

---

### **The Holiness of the Trinity**
- *"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come." (Revelation 4:8)*  
- *"And one called out to another and said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.'" (Isaiah 6:3)*

Each person of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—is perfectly holy, set apart from all creation in absolute purity and moral perfection. The triune God is praised in heaven as "Holy, Holy, Holy," emphasizing the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Together, they are co-equal in their divine holiness, and their nature is the source and standard of all that is holy.

### Scriptural Support for the Holiness of Each Person:
- **The Holiness of the Father**:  
  *"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor." (Habakkuk 1:13)*  
- **The Holiness of the Son**:  
  *"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." (1 Peter 1:19)*  
- **The Holiness of the Holy Spirit**:  
  *"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are." (1 Corinthians 3:16-17)*

---

## **The Nature of God: God the Father**
- *"For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him." (1 Corinthians 8:6)*  
- *"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him." (Ephesians 1:3-4)*  
- *"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all." (Psalm 103:19)*

God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, is the sovereign Creator of all things, ordaining all things according to His will and purpose. He exercises authority over all creation, providence, and redemption. His fatherhood is twofold: He is the Creator and Father of all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is the spiritual Father only to those who are in Christ, adopted into His family through faith (Romans 8:14-15).

God the Father has decreed all things for His glory and continually upholds and governs all creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His holiness, He neither authors nor approves sin, and He preserves the moral accountability of His creation (Habakkuk 1:13). From eternity, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His children to the praise of His glorious grace (Ephesians 1:4-6).

### **Key Attributes and Works of the Father**:
- **God the Father generates the Son for all eternity** *"My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.”; "For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;"(John 5:17;26)*
- **God the Father who is the author of the decree that brings to pass all that He wills** *"I will announce the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, ‘You are My Son, Today I have fathered You.(Psalm 2:7-9)*
- **God the Father works in the election of the saints** *Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love 5He predestined us to adoption as sons and daughters through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He favored us in the Beloved (Ephesians 1:3-6)*
- **God the Father sent His Son to do the work of redemption** *But the testimony I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me (John 5:36)*
- **God the Father disciplines His children** *Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? (Hebrews 12:9)*

## The Nature of God: God the Son

I believe that God the Son, Jesus Christ, is the second person of the Trinity. He is fully God and fully man, having been born of a virgin through the power of the Holy Spirit. He lived a sinless life, performed miracles, and taught with divine authority. Jesus willingly gave His life on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of the world, was buried, and rose bodily from the dead on the third day, securing eternal life for all who believe in Him. Jesus ascended to heaven and now sits at the right hand of the Father, interceding on our behalf, and will return in power and glory to judge the living and the dead.

- **Key Scriptures**: 
   - John 1:1, 14 – *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."*
   - Philippians 2:6-8 – *"Who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men."*
   - 1 Peter 2:24 – *"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."*
   - Hebrews 1:3 – *"And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power."*

### The Nature of God: God the Holy Spirit

I believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, fully divine and equal with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit was active in creation and is continually at work in the world today. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, regenerates and sanctifies believers, indwells all who trust in Christ, and empowers them for godly living and service. The Holy Spirit guides believers into all truth, equips them with spiritual gifts for the edification of the church, and seals them for the day of redemption.

- **Key Scriptures**: 
   - John 14:16-17 – *"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you."*
   - Acts 1:8 – *"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth."*
   - Romans 8:9 – *"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."*
   - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 – *"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body."*

### **Creation**
I believe that God created the universe out of nothing by His word in **six literal days**, as described in Genesis. Jesus Christ, the Creator, brought all things into existence, and everything reflects His sovereign design. Creation glorifies God and reveals His power.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Genesis 1:1* – "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."
  - *Colossians 1:16-17* – "For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth."

---

### **Providence**
I believe in the **providence of God**, whereby He governs all events, both big and small, according to His eternal plan. Even though I am responsible for my actions, God's providential care directs my path. Even the dust particles in the sunlight move according to His sovereign will.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Psalm 139:7-10* – "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"
  - *Proverbs 16:9* – "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

---

### **Salvation**
I believe that "Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone"
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Ephesians 2:8-9* – "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
  - *Titus 3:5* – "He saved us... according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration."
  - *Romans 5:1* – "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."

---

### **Eschatology (End Times)**
I believe in a **pre-tribulation rapture**, a **literal seven-year tribulation**, followed by Christ’s **1,000-year reign** on earth. These events will culminate in the final judgment and the new heaven and new earth, where believers will dwell with God forever.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Thessalonians 4:16-17* – "The dead in Christ will rise first... we who are alive will be caught up."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – "And He laid hold of the dragon... and bound him for a thousand years."
  - *Revelation 6-19* – Describes the seven-year tribulation.

---

### **Purpose of Man**
I believe that the **chief end of man** is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. My ultimate purpose in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy in Him.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Corinthians 10:31* – "Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
  - *Psalm 73:25-26* – "Whom have I in heaven but You?"
  - *Romans 11:36* – "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

---

### **Salvation**
Salvation is a gift of **God's grace** through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**. It is not based on human works but on the redemptive work of Christ. Believers are justified by faith and adopted as children of God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:23-24; John 3:16

#### Scripture references
##### 1 Corinthians 2:7-15
*but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory; 8the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 9but just as it is written,
“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,
And which have not entered the heart of man,
All that God has prepared for those who love Him.”
10 For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. 11For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. 12Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 13which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.
14But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. 15But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. 16For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.*
##### 2 Peter 1:20-21
*But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, 21for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.*
##### 2 Timothy 3:16
*All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.*
##### Matthew 5:18
*For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.*
##### John 16:12-13, 17:17
*“I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.*
*Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.*
##### John 7:17
*If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.*
