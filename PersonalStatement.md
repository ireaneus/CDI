## Personal Statement of Faith

### **God the Father**
I believe that **God the Father** is the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all things. He gave authority to Jesus Christ, His Son, to create the universe, and He directs the course of history according to His providential will. He chose me before the foundation of the world to be His child, redeemed through His grace.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."
  - *Ephesians 1:4-5* – "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world."
  - *Proverbs 16:9* – "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

### **Jesus Christ**
I believe that **Jesus Christ**, the second person of the Trinity, is fully God and fully man. He is the agent of creation and the Redeemer of humanity. He died for my sins, rose from the dead, and through His work, I have been saved by grace alone, through faith. His return will usher in the 1,000-year reign and the final judgment.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Colossians 1:16* – "For by Him all things were created."
  - *John 14:6* – "I am the way, and the truth, and the life."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – Describes Christ's 1,000-year reign.

### **The Holy Spirit**
I believe in the **Holy Spirit**, the third person of the Trinity, who regenerates and sanctifies believers. The Holy Spirit indwells, guides, and empowers me for godly living, ensuring my growth in Christlikeness. He is my comforter and the One who applies the work of Christ to my life.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *John 14:16-17* – "The Spirit of truth... abides with you and will be in you."
  - *Romans 8:9* – "You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you."

### **Creation**
I believe that God created the universe out of nothing by His word in **six literal days**, as described in Genesis. Jesus Christ, the Creator, brought all things into existence, and everything reflects His sovereign design. Creation glorifies God and reveals His power.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Genesis 1:1* – "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."
  - *Colossians 1:16-17* – "For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth."

---

### **Providence**
I believe in the **providence of God**, whereby He governs all events, both big and small, according to His eternal plan. Even though I am responsible for my actions, God's providential care directs my path. Even the dust particles in the sunlight move according to His sovereign will.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Psalm 139:7-10* – "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"
  - *Proverbs 16:9* – "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

---

### **Salvation**
I believe that salvation is by **grace alone**, through **faith alone**, in **Christ alone**. Before the foundation of the world, God chose me for salvation. Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, I am redeemed, justified, and adopted as a child of God. This salvation is not by works but by the finished work of Christ.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Ephesians 2:8-9* – "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
  - *Titus 3:5* – "He saved us... according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration."
  - *Romans 5:1* – "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."

---

### **Eschatology (End Times)**
I believe in a **pre-tribulation rapture**, a **literal seven-year tribulation**, followed by Christ’s **1,000-year reign** on earth. These events will culminate in the final judgment and the new heaven and new earth, where believers will dwell with God forever.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Thessalonians 4:16-17* – "The dead in Christ will rise first... we who are alive will be caught up."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – "And He laid hold of the dragon... and bound him for a thousand years."
  - *Revelation 6-19* – Describes the seven-year tribulation.

### **Purpose of Man**
I believe that the **chief end of man** is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. My ultimate purpose in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy in Him.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Corinthians 10:31* – "Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
  - *Psalm 73:25-26* – "Whom have I in heaven but You?"
  - *Romans 11:36* – "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

### **The Five Solas**
I affirm the **Five Solas** of the Reformation:
- **Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone)**: The Bible is the ultimate authority in all matters of faith.
- **Sola Fide (Faith Alone)**: Justification is by faith alone.
- **Sola Gratia (Grace Alone)**: Salvation is by grace alone.
- **Solus Christus (Christ Alone)**: Christ is the only mediator and savior.
- **Soli Deo Gloria (To the Glory of God Alone)**: All of life is for God’s glory.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *2 Timothy 3:16-17* – "All Scripture is inspired by God."
  - *Romans 5:1* – "Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."
  - *Ephesians 2:8-9* – "By grace you have been saved through faith."
  - *John 14:6* – "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
  - *1 Corinthians 10:31* – "Do all to the glory of God."

### **Personal Testimony**
I believe that my salvation is solely the work of Christ, who chose me before the foundation of the world and saved me by His grace. Though I once relied on my own efforts, I came to understand the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice and the sovereignty of God in all things. The doctrines of grace and the truth of the Five Solas have transformed my walk with the Lord, grounding me in His Word and deepening my faith. Now, I live with the hope of Christ’s return and the joy of glorifying God in all that I do.
