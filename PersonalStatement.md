## Personal Statement of Faith
### My Chief End in Life
I believe that my chief end in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy and satisfaction in Him. As stated in the Westminster Confession, "Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever," I hold this as my guiding principle and desire in all aspects of my life.

**Scripture References**:
- 1 Corinthians 10:31 – "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
- Psalm 73:25-26 – "Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
- Romans 11:36 – "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

### Statement of Faith: The Bible

I believe that the Bible is God's written revelation to mankind, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and forming the plenary (inspired equally in all parts) and verbally inspired Word of God (2 Peter 1:20-21). These Scriptures are absolutely inerrant, infallible, and immutable in their original form, serving as God’s perfect revelation to humanity (2 Timothy 3:16). 

I affirm the literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation, which upholds the belief that the opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days (Genesis 1:31; Exodus 31:17), and that all Scripture is to be understood in its proper context as guided by the Holy Spirit (John 16:12-15). Along with the six literal days, the Bible can be interpreted literally, for example, Judas leaving before the institution of communion (John 13:26-30), the three days and three nights that Jesus spent in the grave (Matthew 12:40), the timing of His crucifixion to coincide with the national Passover lamb sacrifice (John 19:14), and the three hours of literal darkness across the earth during His death (Matthew 27:45).

I believe that the Bible constitutes the only infallible rule of faith and practice, eternally relevant and authoritative over all aspects of life (Matthew 5:18; John 17:17). I believe that God spoke through human authors by a process of dual authorship, ensuring His message was perfectly conveyed without error in the whole or in part (2 Peter 1:20-21). While there may be many applications of any given passage, there is but one true interpretation. It is the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of Scripture.

**Scripture References**:
- **2 Timothy 3:16-17** – "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work."
- **2 Peter 1:20-21** – "But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."
- **Matthew 5:18** – "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished."
- **John 17:17** – "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."
- **Genesis 1:31** – "God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
- **John 19:14** – "Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, 'Behold, your King!'"

### The Nature of God

I believe that God is eternal, infinite, and unchanging, existing as one essence in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, possessing all knowledge, power, and authority. God is perfectly holy, just, and righteous, without sin or imperfection. He is good and merciful, the source of all truth, and sovereign over all creation. God is self-existent, having no cause, and He is the ultimate standard of all that is right and just. His nature is fully revealed in His Word, through His actions in history, and supremely in the person of Jesus Christ.

### Key Attributes of God:
- **Eternal**: God has no beginning or end (Psalm 90:2).
- **Infinite**: God is without limits or boundaries (Jeremiah 23:24).
- **Immutable**: God never changes (Malachi 3:6).
- **Omnipotent**: God is all-powerful (Job 42:2).
- **Omnipresent**: God is present everywhere (Psalm 139:7-10).
- **Omniscient**: God knows all things (Isaiah 46:9-10).
- **Holy**: God is perfectly set apart from all sin (Isaiah 6:3).
- **Just**: God is perfectly righteous in all His judgments (Deuteronomy 32:4).
- **Good**: God is the source of all goodness (Psalm 34:8).
- **Sovereign**: God rules over all creation with supreme authority (Psalm 103:19).
- **Self-existent**: God exists independently of anything else (Exodus 3:14).

### The Nature of God: The Trinity

I believe in one God who exists eternally in three distinct persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are co-equal in essence, nature, and attributes. These three persons of the Godhead share the same divine nature and operate in perfect unity, without division or separation. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, yet there is only one God. God is Spirit, infinite, and transcendent, and though He is actively involved in creation, He is not confined by physical space or human limitations.

**God is holy, as revealed in Scripture:**

- The Father is described as holy in John 17:11 – “Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.”
- The Son is described as holy in Mark 1:24 – “What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”
- The Holy Spirit is also described as holy in John 14:26 – “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.”
- Revelation 15:4 affirms that "only God is holy."

**Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were all involved in the creation, acting as equal co-Creators:**

- Genesis 1:1 – “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”
- John 1:3 – “All things came into being through Him [the Son], and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.”
- Job 33:4 – “The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.”

God is not limited by human comprehension, yet He has chosen to reveal Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, distinct in person but unified in essence. The God we worship is not dependent on anything in creation, but He sustains all things by His will and power.

**Key Scriptures**: 
- Deuteronomy 6:4 – *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!"*
- Matthew 28:19 – *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."*
- 2 Corinthians 13:14 – *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."* 
- **John 4:24** – *“God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”*
- **1 Kings 8:27** – *"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this temple which I have built!"*
- **Acts 17:24-25** – *“God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. Nor is He worshiped with men’s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.”*

### The Nature of God: God the Father

I believe that God the Father, the first Person of the Trinity, orders and disposes all things according to His own purpose and grace (Psalm 145:8-9; 1 Corinthians 8:6). He is the Creator of all things (Genesis 1:1-31; Ephesians 3:9) and the only absolute and omnipotent Ruler of the universe. He exercises sovereignty in creation, providence, and redemption (Psalm 103:19; Romans 11:36). His fatherhood involves both His eternal role within the Trinity and His relationship with humanity. As Creator, He is the Father of all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is the spiritual Father only to believers (Romans 8:14; 2 Corinthians 6:18). He has decreed all things that come to pass for His own glory (Ephesians 1:11).

God continually upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His sovereignty, He is neither the author nor the approver of sin (Habakkuk 1:13; John 8:38-47), and He does not diminish the moral accountability of His intelligent creatures (1 Peter 1:17). From eternity past, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His own, to the praise of His glory (Ephesians 1:4-6). He saves from sin all who come to Him through Jesus Christ and, upon adoption, becomes Father to His redeemed (John 1:12; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:5; Hebrews 12:5-9).

- **Key Scriptures**: 
   - John 6:38 – *"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."*
   - Ephesians 1:3-6 – *"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."*
   - 1 Corinthians 8:6 – *"Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him."*

### The Nature of God: God the Son

I believe that God the Son, Jesus Christ, is the second person of the Trinity. He is fully God and fully man, having been born of a virgin through the power of the Holy Spirit. He lived a sinless life, performed miracles, and taught with divine authority. Jesus willingly gave His life on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of the world, was buried, and rose bodily from the dead on the third day, securing eternal life for all who believe in Him. Jesus ascended to heaven and now sits at the right hand of the Father, interceding on our behalf, and will return in power and glory to judge the living and the dead.

- **Key Scriptures**: 
   - John 1:1, 14 – *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."*
   - Philippians 2:6-8 – *"Who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men."*
   - 1 Peter 2:24 – *"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."*
   - Hebrews 1:3 – *"And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power."*

### The Nature of God: God the Holy Spirit

I believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, fully divine and equal with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit was active in creation and is continually at work in the world today. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, regenerates and sanctifies believers, indwells all who trust in Christ, and empowers them for godly living and service. The Holy Spirit guides believers into all truth, equips them with spiritual gifts for the edification of the church, and seals them for the day of redemption.

- **Key Scriptures**: 
   - John 14:16-17 – *"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you."*
   - Acts 1:8 – *"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth."*
   - Romans 8:9 – *"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."*
   - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 – *"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body."*

### **Creation**
I believe that God created the universe out of nothing by His word in **six literal days**, as described in Genesis. Jesus Christ, the Creator, brought all things into existence, and everything reflects His sovereign design. Creation glorifies God and reveals His power.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Genesis 1:1* – "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."
  - *Colossians 1:16-17* – "For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth."

---

### **Providence**
I believe in the **providence of God**, whereby He governs all events, both big and small, according to His eternal plan. Even though I am responsible for my actions, God's providential care directs my path. Even the dust particles in the sunlight move according to His sovereign will.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Psalm 139:7-10* – "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"
  - *Proverbs 16:9* – "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

---

### **Salvation**
I believe that "Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone"
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Ephesians 2:8-9* – "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
  - *Titus 3:5* – "He saved us... according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration."
  - *Romans 5:1* – "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."

---

### **Eschatology (End Times)**
I believe in a **pre-tribulation rapture**, a **literal seven-year tribulation**, followed by Christ’s **1,000-year reign** on earth. These events will culminate in the final judgment and the new heaven and new earth, where believers will dwell with God forever.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Thessalonians 4:16-17* – "The dead in Christ will rise first... we who are alive will be caught up."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – "And He laid hold of the dragon... and bound him for a thousand years."
  - *Revelation 6-19* – Describes the seven-year tribulation.

---

### **Purpose of Man**
I believe that the **chief end of man** is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. My ultimate purpose in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy in Him.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Corinthians 10:31* – "Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
  - *Psalm 73:25-26* – "Whom have I in heaven but You?"
  - *Romans 11:36* – "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

---

### **Salvation**
Salvation is a gift of **God's grace** through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**. It is not based on human works but on the redemptive work of Christ. Believers are justified by faith and adopted as children of God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:23-24; John 3:16

#### Scripture references
##### 1 Corinthians 2:7-15
*but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory; 8the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 9but just as it is written,
“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,
And which have not entered the heart of man,
All that God has prepared for those who love Him.”
10 For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. 11For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. 12Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 13which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.
14But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. 15But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. 16For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.*
##### 2 Peter 1:20-21
*But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, 21for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.*
##### 2 Timothy 3:16
*All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.*
##### Matthew 5:18
*For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.*
##### John 16:12-13, 17:17
*“I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.*
*Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.*
##### John 7:17
*If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.*
