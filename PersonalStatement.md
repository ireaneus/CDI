## Personal Statement of Faith

### My chief end in Life

I believe that my chief end in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy and satisfaction in Him. As stated in the Westminster Confession, "Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever," I hold this as my guiding principle and desire in all aspects of my life.

**Scripture References**:
- 1 Corinthians 10:31 – "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
- Psalm 73:25-26 – "Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
- Romans 11:36 – "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

1. ### Statement of Faith: The Bible
- I believe the Bible is God’s written revelation to mankind, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and forming the complete and authoritative Word of God (1 Corinthians 2:7,14; 2 Peter 1:20-21).

- I affirm the plenary (full) and verbal inspiration of Scripture, meaning that every word in all parts of the Bible is equally inspired. Through God's providence, He predetermined the authors, shaping their personalities, circumstances, and environments to ensure they wrote exactly what He intended, without error in the original manuscripts. These Scriptures are infallible, inerrant, and immutable in their original form, serving as God’s perfect revelation to mankind (2 Timothy 3:16).

- The Bible is the sole infallible rule of faith and practice, eternally relevant and authoritative over all aspects of life (Matthew 5:18; John 17:17).

**Key Scriptures (NASB1995):**
- 1 Corinthians 2:7, 14 – *"But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory... But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised."*

- 2 Peter 1:20-21 – *"But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."*

- 2 Timothy 3:16 – *"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness."*

- Matthew 5:18 – *"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished."*

- John 17:17 – *"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."*

2. What is the nature of God?

I believe in One God, who exists eternally in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are distinct but co-equal in essence, nature, and attributes. The three persons of the Godhead share the same divine nature and operate in perfect unity, without division or separation. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, yet there is only one God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14

   a. What do you believe about the Trinity?
   
*We teach there is but one living and true God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5-7; I Corinthians 8:4), an infinite, all knowing Spirit (John 4:24), perfect in all His attributes, one in essence, eternally existing in three Persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19; II Corinthians 13:14) – each equally deserving worship and obedience.*

   b. What do you believe about God the Father?

   c. What do you believe about God the Son?

   d. What do you believe about God the Holy Spirit?

3. What do you believe about the works of God?
4. What do you believe about angels?
5. What do you believe about Satan?
6. What do you believe about the nature of man?
7. What do you believe about sin?
8. What do you believe about salvation?
9. What do you believe about the Church?
10. What do you believe about Heaven and Hell?
11. What do you believe about resurrection?
12. What do you believe about judgment?
13. What do you believe about Jesus’ second coming?
14. What do you believe about eternity?

### **God the Father**
I believe that **God the Father** is the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all things. He gave authority to Jesus Christ, His Son, to create the universe, and He directs the course of history according to His providential will.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."

---

### **Jesus Christ**
I believe that **Jesus Christ**, the second person of the Trinity, is fully God and fully man. He is the agent of creation and the Redeemer of humanity. He died for my sins, rose from the dead, and through His work, I have been saved by grace alone, through faith. His return will usher in the 1,000-year reign and the final judgment.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Colossians 1:16* – "For by Him all things were created."
  - *John 14:6* – "I am the way, and the truth, and the life."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – Describes Christ's 1,000-year reign.

---

### **The Holy Spirit**
I believe in the **Holy Spirit**, the third person of the Trinity, who regenerates and sanctifies believers. The Holy Spirit indwells, guides, and empowers me for godly living, ensuring my growth in Christlikeness. He is my comforter and the One who applies the work of Christ to my life.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *John 14:16-17* – "The Spirit of truth... abides with you and will be in you."
  - *Romans 8:9* – "You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you."

---

### **Creation**
I believe that God created the universe out of nothing by His word in **six literal days**, as described in Genesis. Jesus Christ, the Creator, brought all things into existence, and everything reflects His sovereign design. Creation glorifies God and reveals His power.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Genesis 1:1* – "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."
  - *Colossians 1:16-17* – "For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth."

---

### **Providence**
I believe in the **providence of God**, whereby He governs all events, both big and small, according to His eternal plan. Even though I am responsible for my actions, God's providential care directs my path. Even the dust particles in the sunlight move according to His sovereign will.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Psalm 139:7-10* – "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"
  - *Proverbs 16:9* – "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

---

### **Salvation**
I believe that "Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone"
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Ephesians 2:8-9* – "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
  - *Titus 3:5* – "He saved us... according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration."
  - *Romans 5:1* – "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."

---

### **Eschatology (End Times)**
I believe in a **pre-tribulation rapture**, a **literal seven-year tribulation**, followed by Christ’s **1,000-year reign** on earth. These events will culminate in the final judgment and the new heaven and new earth, where believers will dwell with God forever.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Thessalonians 4:16-17* – "The dead in Christ will rise first... we who are alive will be caught up."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – "And He laid hold of the dragon... and bound him for a thousand years."
  - *Revelation 6-19* – Describes the seven-year tribulation.

---

### **Purpose of Man**
I believe that the **chief end of man** is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. My ultimate purpose in life is to worship, serve, and honor God in everything I do, finding my deepest joy in Him.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Corinthians 10:31* – "Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
  - *Psalm 73:25-26* – "Whom have I in heaven but You?"
  - *Romans 11:36* – "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."

---

### **Personal Testimony**
I believe that my salvation is solely the work of Christ, who chose me before the foundation of the world and saved me by His grace. Though I once relied on my own efforts, I came to understand the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice and the sovereignty of God in all things. The doctrines of grace and the truth of the Five Solas have transformed my walk with the Lord, grounding me in His Word and deepening my faith. Now, I live with the hope of Christ’s return and the joy of glorifying God in all that I do.

### God the Father
God the Father is the first person of the Trinity, the eternal and sovereign Creator of the universe. He is the source of all things and the one who sustains all creation by His power. The Father is both transcendent, above all creation, and immanent, actively involved in the world and with His people.
- **Key Scriptures**: Genesis 1:1; John 3:16; Ephesians 1:3-5

---

### **God the Son (Jesus Christ)**
Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, is the second person of the Trinity. Through His death and resurrection, He accomplished the redemption of humanity. He is the only mediator between God and man.
- **Key Scriptures**: John 1:1, 14; Philippians 2:6-8; 1 Timothy 2:5

---

### **God the Holy Spirit**
The Holy Spirit indwells believers, guiding, sanctifying, and empowering them for service. He convicts the world of sin and leads believers into all truth.
- **Key Scriptures**: John 14:16-17; Acts 1:8; Romans 8:9

---

### **Salvation**
Salvation is a gift of **God's grace** through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**. It is not based on human works but on the redemptive work of Christ. Believers are justified by faith and adopted as children of God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:23-24; John 3:16

#### Scripture references
##### 1 Corinthians 2:7-15
*but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory; 8the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 9but just as it is written,
“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,
And which have not entered the heart of man,
All that God has prepared for those who love Him.”
10 For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. 11For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. 12Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 13which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.
14But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. 15But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. 16For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.*
##### 2 Peter 1:20-21
*But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, 21for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.*
##### 2 Timothy 3:16
*All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.*
##### Matthew 5:18
*For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.*
##### John 16:12-13, 17:17
*“I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.*
*Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.*
##### John 7:17
*If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.*
