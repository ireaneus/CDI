## I. The Preface 1:1-4  
## II. The Preparation of the Savior vs. 1:5-2:52  

### **Luke Chapter 1**  
**_In Chapter 1, Luke_** recounts the angel Gabriel’s announcements to Zechariah and Mary about the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively. Mary visits Elizabeth, and John is born, with Zechariah prophesying about God’s salvation plan (*vs. 67-80*). **_Christ is presented as_** *"Son of the Most High"* whose arrival fulfills God’s covenant to David and Abraham (*vs. 32-33, 54-55*). **_I believe with Zechariah,_** on the whole of his prophecy but my key verse is *“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people”* (*vs. 68*).  

### **Luke Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Luke_** recounts the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, the shepherds’ visitation, His presentation at the temple, and the account of His interaction with the teachers in Jerusalem as a boy. **_Christ is presented as_** *“a Savior, who is Christ the Lord”* (*vs. 11*), proclaimed to the shepherds at His birth. **_I believe my key verse is,_** *“A Light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel”* (*vs. 32*), spoken by Simeon. *"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”* (*vs. 14*), proclaimed by the heavenly host at His birth.

## The introduction of the Savior vs. 3:1-4:15

### **Luke Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Luke_** describes the ministry of John the Baptist, who preaches repentance for the forgiveness of sins and baptizes Jesus. John declares the coming of one mightier than himself, and Jesus’ baptism is marked by the descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. **_Christ is presented as_** *“My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased”* (*vs. 22*), as declared by the Father at His baptism. **_I believe my key verse is,_** *“John answered and said to them all, ‘As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire’”* (*vs. 16*).

## IV. The Ministry of the Savior 4:16-9:50  

### **Luke Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Luke_** records Jesus’ temptation in the wilderness, His inaugural teaching in the synagogue of Nazareth, and the beginning of His healing and deliverance ministry in Capernaum. Jesus declares the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy, and rebukes Satan’s temptations by quoting Scripture. **_Christ is presented as_** *"The fulfillment of Scripture" (*vs. 21*)  **_I believe my key verse is,_** *““I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.”* (*vs. 43*) because the main theme of the Bible is about Christ and His Kingdom.

### **Luke Chapter 5**  
**_In Chapter 5, Jesus_** calls His first disciples, heals a leper, forgives and heals a paralytic, and calls Levi (Matthew) to follow Him. He demonstrates His power over sickness, sin, and the hearts of men. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the Son of Man who has authority on earth to forgive sins”* (*vs. 24*). **_Believers should_** listen and obey Him, saying, *“Master, I will do as You say”* (*vs. 5*), humbly acknowledge their sinfulness, *“Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!”* (*vs. 8*), and respond to His call, *“Follow Me”* (*vs. 27*).

### **Luke Chapter 6**  
**_In Chapter 6, Jesus_** declares Himself Lord of the Sabbath, teaches the Beatitudes, and calls His followers to love their enemies, judge not, and bear good fruit. He also heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, confronting the Pharisees. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the Son of Man [who] is Lord of the Sabbath”* (*vs. 5*). **_I rejoice and trust in,_** *“Blessed are you when people hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you… Rejoice on that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven”* (*vs. 22-23*), looking forward to when He says to me, *“Well done, good and faithful servant”* (*Matthew 25:21*).

### **Luke Chapter 7**  
**_In Chapter 7, Jesus_** heals the centurion’s servant, raises a widow’s son from the dead, and commends John the Baptist’s ministry. He forgives the sins of a woman who anoints His feet with perfume, declaring her faith has saved her. **_Christ is presented as_** *“a great prophet”* (*vs. 16*) and *"The Expected One"* (*vs. 19, Isaiah 35:5-6, Isaiah 61:1*). **_Believers should_** consider themselves unworthy, as the centurion did when he said, *“I am not worthy for You to come under my roof”* (*vs. 6*). *“But a man must examine himself,”* (*1 Corinthians 11:28*).

### **Luke Chapter 8**  
**_In Chapter 8, Luke_** recounts Jesus teaching in parables, calming a storm, casting out demons from a man in the Gerasenes, healing a woman with a hemorrhage, and raising Jairus’ daughter from the dead. Despite Jesus saying, *“Let us go over to the other side”* (*vs. 22*), the disciples’ fear during the storm reveals their struggle to fully trust in His word. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the one whom even the wind and the waves obey”* (*vs. 25*), demonstrating His sovereign authority over creation and life. **_I want to be that guy,_** who, after being healed, obeyed Jesus’ command to *“Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you”* (*vs. 39*), sharing his testimony with the entire city.
