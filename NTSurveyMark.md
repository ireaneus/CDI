## Part One: The Presentation of the Servant (1:1 - 2:12)

---

**Chapter 1**  
**_In Chapter 1, Mark_** declares Jesus as the Son of God, affirmed by the Father *(vs. 11)*. Jesus begins His ministry by proclaiming the gospel, calling His first disciples to follow Him *(vs. 16-20)*, and demonstrating His authority as the Promised One (*Micah 5:2*) by casting out demons *(vs. 25)*, healing Simon’s mother-in-law *(vs. 31)*, and cleansing a leper *(vs. 41)*.  **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah foretold in the Old Testament, the one who would *“open the eyes of the blind, unstop the ears of the deaf… and the lame will leap like a deer”* (*Isaiah 35:5-6*). By instructing the leper *"to show yourself to the priests"* *(vs. 44)*, Jesus performed one of the Messianic prophecies publicly to the nation of Israel, demonstrating that He is the long-awaited Messiah. **_Believers should_** "repent and believe in the gospel" *(vs. 15)*, and "Follow Me, and become fishers of men" *(vs. 17)*, proclaiming the good news everywhere. This is because *"The time is fulfilled"* *(vs. 14)*, and the Kingdom of God is at hand *(vs. 14-15, 38)*.

**Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Mark_** describes Jesus as both the *"Bridegroom"* and *"the Lord of the Sabbath"*. Jesus forgives the sins of a paralytic *(vs. 5)*, proving His authority by healing the man *(vs. 10-11)*, and calls Levi (Matthew), a tax collector, to follow Him *(vs. 14)*. He teaches that He has come for sinners, not the righteous *(vs. 17)*. Jesus also defends His disciples' actions on the Sabbath, *(vs. 27)*, and proclaims Himself as the *“Lord even of the Sabbath” (vs. 28)*. **_Christ is presented as_** the Bridegroom, who brings joy and renewal through a new covenant relationship with God, as He explains: *“As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast”* (vs. 19). He is also the Lord of the Sabbath, who restores its true purpose by forgiving sins and providing eternal rest and reconciliation, fulfilling its spiritual significance (*Hebrews vs. 27-28, 4:9-10*). **_Believers should_** rejoice in the Bridegroom, celebrating the joy and renewal that comes through their relationship with Him (vs. 19). They should also rest in Him, knowing He has forgiven their sins and provides eternal spiritual rest, freeing them from guilt and striving for righteousness through works, as He declared: *“The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath”* (vs. 28).


**Chapter 3**  
*In the third chapter,* Jesus enters the synagogue and heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, and the Pharisees immediately begin conspiring with the Herodians against Him. Large crowds follow Jesus, and He appoints the twelve apostles, "so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach" (*Mark 3:14*). *Christ is presented as* one who declares, *“Whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother”* (*Mark 3:35*). *Believers should* do the will of God and follow Jesus’ teachings, understanding that *“a house divided against itself cannot stand”* (*Mark 3:25*).
