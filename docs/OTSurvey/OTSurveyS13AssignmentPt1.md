**In The Previous Session**

- We surveyed the Hebrew wisdom literature in *Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon*. These are grouped together in the Septuagint and usually referred to as the books of poetry.
- Though the Psalms are filled with wisdom we dealt with that book separately as the songs of the Hebrews.
- In the Wisdom Literature we saw Job, in his suffering, as a type of Christ.
- Job was *“blameless and upright,”* (**Job 1:8**), yet he was tested to the limit and he too, as Jesus did, learned from what he had suffered. **Hebrews 5:8**
- In Proverbs we were offered timeless advice for faithful living.
- We saw Wisdom personified preparing us for the revelation of Jesus, *“in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”* **Colossians 2:3**
- In Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon we were given two unique perspectives of life.
- In Ecclesiastes we saw Solomon’s investigations into life *“under the sun,”* yet was fully conscious of God’s presence. This speaks of Jesus, who fully entered into our human experience.
- The Song of Solomon is a musical about love between a man and a woman.
- We see God’s love for Israel and Jesus’ love for his bride, the Church.

**Background on Ezra/Nehemiah**

- The Tanakh and early manuscripts combined Ezra and Nehemiah in one book.
- Other collections separated the books but called them 1-2 Ezra.
- There are important similarities, but they are now recognized as separate works.
- Ezra appears in Nehemiah 8, and both books cover similar historical events.
- They include the concise record of the exiles who returned from Babylon to rebuild the Temple and the city of Jerusalem.
- They were written by two separate authors. If Ezra had written both books, he would not have repeated himself.

**Background on Ezra, the Man**

- Ezra was an excellent historian.
- *He is considered to be the author of the Chronicles: the history of Jerusalem and the tribe of Judah*.
- Ezra was concerned that the Jews of the Babylonian captivity who had been taken from Jerusalem would be taught the history of their parents’ failures.
- The key verse of his book and of his life: *“Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.”* **Ezra 7:10**

**First Part of the Book of Ezra**

- In the first 6 chapters, Ezra is writing history.
- *The decree of Cyrus in Ezra 1 and the list of exiles in Ezra 2 are records of events that happened 60 years before he came to Jerusalem*.
- The struggles of the first exiles to rebuild the temple (Ezra 3-6) and the ministries of the prophets *Haggai and Zechariah* **(Ezra 5:1)**, *happened before Ezra was born*.
- Ezra does finally come to Jerusalem and Ezra 7-10 are first person accounts of his ministry there.
- The account of the difficulties the exiles had in their efforts to restore the Temple gives an important backdrop for appreciating the ministries of *Haggai and Zechariah*. Ezra 3-6
- Ezra painted a picture of how hard life was for the small remnant of Jews back in Jerusalem but surrounded by hostile nations.
- Their being allowed to return and rebuild the temple was the LORD’s desire to help his people keep alive the hope of his coming.
- Original text of Ezra 4:8–6:18 was written in *Aramaic*, the language used for business and commerce after the return from Babylon.
**Second Part of Ezra**
- Ezra 7-10 record his journey to Jerusalem and his ministry on arriving there.
- Ezra 9-10 describe his response when he discovers that the Jews had begun intermarrying with their Gentile neighbors.
- His prayer of repentance in Ezra 9, motivates the difficult response as those who had sinned repented and separated from their foreign wives. Ezra 10:11
- Ezra understood that the promised Anointed One, from David’s line, was still to come.
- He was concerned that his people not fall into the trap of marriage with unbelievers as their ancestors had and suffered terrible consequences.

**Nehemiah Chapter One**

- Nehemiah was a Jew in a position of great responsibility in Persia.
- While carrying out his duties, he receives news that the Jews in Jerusalem *“are in great trouble and disgrace.”* **Nehemiah 1:3**
- Jerusalem’s wall is broken down and the residents are at the mercy of their hostile neighbors.
- Nehemiah’s heart breaks for the desperate needs of his people. He fasts and prays and then gets to work.
- He is *“cupbearer to the king,”* **(Nehemiah 1:11)**, a position of great responsibility.
- When the king notices his sadness and asks why, Nehemiah asks permission to go to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city.

**Nehemiah Travels to Jerusalem**

- Nehemiah immediately surveys the situation and says, *“Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.”* **Nehemiah 2:17**
- Opposition immediately begins. The next several chapters describe various attempts by enemies to stop the project.

**Nehemiah as a Competent Construction Foreman**

- Nehemiah’s strategy of giving many groups of people the responsibility for sections of the wall is smart and effective.
- As the wall begins to rise, so did the enemy opposition.
- Nehemiah faces each attempt to discourage the workers with prayer and wisdom.
- His strategy of posting family groups to guard low places in the wall would increase the courage of the people as they defend their own loved ones. **Nehemiah 4:13**
- He says, *“Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”* Nehemiah 4:14
- Next, he made sure the workers were guarded and armed, *“Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other.”* **Nehemiah 4:17**
- He consistently attacks problems with multiple solutions in case some don’t succeed.
- Nehemiah 5 relates his efforts to maintain unity among the people.
- He recognizes unjust practices, confronts the wealthy, and puts things right.
- The wall is completed *“in fifty-two days.”* **Nehemiah 6:15**
- The enemies of the Jews were confounded because *“they realized that this work had been done with the help of God.”* **Nehemiah 6:16**

**Ezra Comes to Jerusalem**

- Nehemiah includes the same list from Ezra of those who returned to Jerusalem many years earlier. Nehemiah 7
- The context of why he again lists the original settlers insures that the true line of the priesthood is maintained.
- Ezra arrives in Jerusalem in Nehemiah 8, instructing the people in the Book of the Law. *“They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was being read.”* **Nehemiah 8:8**
- God’s Word has power to convict and Nehemiah 8-10 confirm this as the people respond to Ezra’s teaching.

**The Wall is Finished**

- The great celebration and dedication of the newly finished wall is recorded in Nehemiah 12.
- Nehemiah went back to Persia, but returns *“some time later”* **(Nehemiah 13:6)** to find more problems needing his attention.
- Three times in the final chapter Nehemiah prays, *“Remember me for this, O my God.”* **(Nehemiah 13:14, 22, 31)** He is asking God to keep account of his faithful service to his people.

**Nehemiah, A Builder**

- Nehemiah is remembered in Scripture as an expert at getting things done.
- He is a planner, an organizer and single-minded – A builder.
- Many in the history of the church have looked to Nehemiah to justify building great facilities.
- Some great principles are found in this book that can guide in important building projects.
- The wall of Jerusalem offered protection from enemies of the Jews and aided them in keeping the commands of God. **Nehemiah 13:15-22**
- The greatest of all builders is our Lord Jesus – He is building His church.
- His Church is made up of *“living stones,”* **(1 Peter 2:5)** but has no walls to keep people out. *“The gates of Hades will not overcome it.”* **Matthew 16:18**

**Esther**

- The story of Esther is the story of the sovereign providence of God.
- There is no mention of God in this book, but his presence is undeniable.
- Her story could illustrate **Romans 8:28**: *“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.”*
- The Jewish celebration of Purim is held each Spring in memory of God’s protection of His people living in Persia around 480 BC.
- *The story takes place in the years between the ministries of Haggai and Zechariah and the coming of Ezra and Nehemiah to Jerusalem, during the reign of Xerxes*.

**Review**

- We briefly surveyed the books of contemporaries Ezra and Nehemiah.
- Ezra was the historian and teacher of the remnant of the Jews returned from 70 years of captivity in Babylon. He understood the importance of guarding the future by learning from the past.
- Nehemiah supervised the rebuilding of the wall so that there could be a future for the Jews. With a wall they could survive; they could close the gates and keep the Sabbath as a day of rest.
- The church today can rest every day in the finished work of Christ.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at the life and prophecies of Daniel.
- He advanced from a captive boy to high authority in Babylon and Persia.
- Daniel was faithful, trustworthy, honest and courageous.
- His prophetic visions have proved minutely accurate in history and some are yet to be fulfilled.
