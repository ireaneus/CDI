## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.61)*

You will KNOW:

- How much more there is to learn from the rest of Genesis 1 about the amazing God who made everything.
- That God would have His people know who He is and that what He has made prepares us to recognize Him.

You will be ABLE TO:

- Know that the Creator began to reveal His nature by the things He created on the first 5 days of creation

You will THINK ABOUT:

- The great themes of the Bible and of the revelation of Jesus that begin in Genesis chapter 1

**Begin video.**

**Review**

- Looked at the first verse in the Bible, *“In the beginning...”*
- In succeeding Scriptures, the Bible authorizes us to recognize Jesus as the Creator of heaven and earth.

**Introductory Sentences**

- We see God as creator of heaven (space) and earth (matter).
- The earth was originally unformed, with no visible light, as yet.
- The Spirit of God was present *“hovering”* over the waters.
- We glimpse the beginning of *“everything that has been made.”*
- Before this time, all that existed was the triune God – no space, no matter whatsoever.
- Third sentence begins *“And God said…”*
- It is the voice of God or the Word of God who calls all things into existence.
- We need to see the Biblical principle that Christ is *“the Word”* who *“became flesh and dwelt among us.”* **John 1:14**

**God's Creative Acts – Light**

- God's acts of creation progressively reveal His nature.
- *“Let there be light”* in **Genesis 1:3** carried a profound depth that has never been fully comprehended. cf., **John 1:5**
- Light is the start of one of the great themes of Scripture:
    - *“God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.”* **1 John 1:5**
    - **Psalm 27:1**, *“The LORD is my light and my salvation.”*
    - **Psalm 36:9**, *“With you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.”*
    - In the wilderness, the LORD went before His people *“by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.”* **Exodus 13:21.**
    - **Psalm 104:2**, *“He wraps himself in light as a garment.”*
    - Isaiah sees the glorious future and proclaims, *“The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.”* **Isaiah 60:19**
    - **Psalm 119:105**, *“Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path,”* reminds us to trust the personal nature of the Lord's guiding presence.
    - Jesus himself stated, *“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”* **John 8:12**

**God's Creative Acts – Air**

- On the second day God spoke the atmosphere of His planet into existence. *“Let there be an expanse between the waters and to separate the waters from the waters...and God called the expanse sky.”* **Genesis 1:6, 8**
- Throughout Scripture we often see the repeated phrase, *“the Maker of heaven and earth.”* **Psalm 121:2**
- The Hebrew words here for *“expanse”* and *“heaven”* are not the same used later in Scripture for *“wind”* and *“air,”* but it is apparent that He makes atmosphere on the second day.
- We’ve already been told about the *“Spirit of God hovering over the waters,”* now we see the beginning of the revelation that *“God is Spirit”* **(John 4:24)** and that *“in Him we live and move and have our being.”* **Acts 17:28**
- The mysterious presence of God the Spirit throughout the history of his dealings with man and the many interconnected references to his *“breath”* begin here on Day 2.

**References to *“the Deep”* and *“the Waters”* – Verse 2**

- This is the beginning of another theme of the revelation of God
- Water is a symbol of the presence of God and this theme of His all sufficiency flows throughout His Word.
- The *“Baptism”* of Moses in the sea. **1 Corinthians 10:2**
- The *“spiritual drink”* from the *“spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.”* **1 Corinthians 10:4**
- The *“waters”* of **Isaiah 55:1**, all these lead us to Jesus who said, *“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink!”* **John 7:37**

**God's Creative Acts – Dry Ground**

- **Romans 1:20 (ESV)** says that *“his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.”*
- The nature of God was revealed again when he creates the dry ground. *“Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.”* **Genesis 1:9**

- Foundational rocks are formed, pointing to the Scriptural theme, *“The LORD is my Rock...my God is my Rock, in whom I take refuge”* **(Psalm 18:2)** which continues throughout Psalms and the Prophets.
    - Daniel explained the king's vision of *“a rock cut out, but not by human hands,”* that *“became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth”* **Daniel 2:34-35**. This signified *“a kingdom that will never be destroyed”* **(Daniel 2:44)**, the kingdom of Christ.
- Jesus told Peter, *“on this rock I will build my church.”* **Matthew 16:18.**
- He recalls Biblical history and the coming glory of the LORD our rock.
- On the third day, God began to create living things. *“Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.”* **Genesis 1:11**
- Though these things are not enlivened by the breath of God as we will see with the animals, they do possess the early characteristics of life in that they are organic in nature and have the ability to reproduce after their own kind.
- These are the first laws of the harvest and eventually lead to the great theme of the *“seed”* or *“offspring”* of Eve, who is Christ.

**God's Creative Acts – Sun, Moon and Stars**

- The fourth day.
- According to God, each day begins with *“the evening.”* **Genesis 1:5, 1:8, 1:13,1:19, 1:23, 1:31.**
- God is the *“Maker of heaven and earth...[who] will neither slumber nor sleep.”* **(Psalm 121:2-4)** We can keep this in mind when thinking of all that He created in one day!
- God made the sun, the moon and the stars with a purpose for each: *“to govern the day”* (the sun), *“to govern the night”* (the moon), and to be for *“signs and for seasons, and for days and for years,”* and *“to give light upon the earth,”* and to *“divide the light from the darkness.”* **Genesis 1:14-18**
- God shows his goodness in these provisions of times and signs and seasons – the timely order of His creation.
- David wrote in **Psalm 19:1-4**: *“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech; they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”*
- Creating the sun, moon and stars as His means for creation to be aware of the passage of time shows God's *“eternal power and divine nature.”* **Romans 1:20**
- God exists independent of time and gives the means to know the value of this present existence and the promise of His eternal presence.
- Moses wrote: “Teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” Psalm 90:12
- Isaiah proclaimed: *“He…brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.”* **Isaiah 40:26**
- We marvel at His omniscience.

**God's Creative Acts – Living Creatures**

- We read about the fifth day in Genesis 1:20-23.
- God's formed *“living creatures”*: the waters *“teem”* with them and birds *“fly above the vault of the sky.”*
- Amazing variety and abundance of life on earth and the genius of their very existence are living testimonies to the brilliance and love of color and ability of their Maker.
- Like the vegetation, these were created *“according to their kinds”* with tremendous variations within their genetic limits.

**Review of This Session**

- Our Creator God who leads us on a path of wonder and worship.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- On the final day of creation, God makes a creature *“in His own image…[and] likeness.”* **Genesis 1:26**
- This same Maker who is the *“image of the invisible God”*, **Colossians 1:15**, will be *“made in human likeness,”* and become *“obedient to death – even death on a cross!”* **Philippians 2:7-8**
