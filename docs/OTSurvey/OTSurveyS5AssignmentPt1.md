**Review of Previous Session**

- Period of history from the fall of Adam to the birth of Abraham.
- The terrible condition of mankind, summed up in **Genesis 6:5**, *“The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.”*
- God determined to wipe mankind from the face of the earth, *“But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.”* **Genesis 6:8**
- God instructed Noah to build the Ark designed to withstand the worldwide cataclysm of the Flood, preserving his family and male and female land animal kinds.
- Both Noah and the Ark are types of Christ: Noah as the one faithful, blameless prophet whose obedient faith led to the salvation of his family; the Ark – with only one door – points to the perfect and only Savior.
- The detailed account of the Flood is a factual record of an earth-reshaping event of unimaginable proportions.
- The time from Noah to Abraham – with particular attention to the Tower of Babel as the event that explains the nations and languages of the present world. Abraham is *“the Father of All Who Believe”* **Romans 4:11**
- We have reached, in one sense, the middle of the Old Testament.
- Abram is introduced at the end of the Genesis 11 genealogies.
- **Genesis 12:1-4**, is where his story of faith begins: *“The LORD had said to Abram, 'Go from your country, your people and your father's household to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you, I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.' So Abram went, as the Lord had told him...”*
- Three main parts to Abram's story of faith:
    - His *“Going in faith”*
    - His *“Great longing for a son”*
    - The *“Giving of his son”* as an offering (next session)

**Abram's “Going in Faith”**

- *“Going”* from Ur and Haran were his first steps of faith.
- Abram was most likely born at Ur Kasdim – the site of an ancient ziggurat dedicated to the worship of the moon-god, Nannar.
    - A Wikipedia article on Ur offers other possibilities.
- **Joshua 24:2-3**, is a commentary on Abram's early experience with idols in his homeland. Joshua said, *“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: 'Long ago your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods.'”*
- New Testament shows Abram's travels were more than simply moving from one place to another.
- Hebrews 11 speaks of spiritual longing in obedience to God's call: *“By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.”* **Hebrews 11:8-10**

**God's Fourfold Promise to Abram**

- In Genesis 12, God makes a fourfold promise which carries far-reaching Biblical significance.
- Keil and Delitzsch, in their Commentary on the Old Testament, state four distinct elements to this promise in Genesis 12:
    - Increase into a numerous people
    - A blessing, that is to say, material and spiritual prosperity
    - The exaltation of his name, the elevation of Abram to honor and glory
    - His appointment to be the possessor and dispenser of the blessing. Abram was not only to receive blessing, but to be a blessing; not only to be blessed by God, but to become a blessing, or the medium of blessing, to others. Keil and Delitzsch Vol. 1
- These promises precede the actual covenant God establishes with Abraham in Genesis 17.
- No conditions were placed on Abram and the promises come to him prior to his *“going”* in faith.
- God commends Abram's act of faith when he went *“even though he did not know where he was going.”* **Hebrews 11:8**
- Abram never did see these promises fulfilled. He lived a nomadic life, traveling as far as Egypt.
- The only land he owned is the burial plot the purchased for the tomb of Sarah in Genesis 23.
- Abram was looking for a *“better country, a heavenly one.”* **Hebrews 11:16**

**Abram and Melchizedek – Genesis 14**

- Backdrop for the story – Abram rescued his nephew Lot and captives of Sodom, who had been taken by kings from the North. **Genesis 14:1-16**
- Returning victorious, Abram is met by *“Melchizedek, King of Salem”* (Genesis 14:18), who brings refreshment to Abram and his weary men.
- Melchizedek *“was a priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying 'Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.'”* **Genesis 14:18-20**
- Abram gives Melchizedek *“a tenth of everything.”* **Genesis 14:20b.**
- Scripture later identifies this mysterious priest as a foreshadowing of our Great High Priest, Jesus. **Psalm 110:4** says of the coming Messiah, *“The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.'”*
- The book of Hebrews draws on this to prove the rightful priesthood of Jesus. Hebrews 5-10
- Melchizedek means, *“king of righteousness”* and is *“King of Salem”* (Jerusalem – city of peace). **Hebrews 7:2**
- Melchizedek is somewhat of a mystery and some have considered him a *“theophany”* or Old Testament appearance of Jesus.
- Others identify him as Noah's son, Shem, who actually outlived Abraham.
- Melchizedek must be considered a Type of Christ and an important participant in Abram's spiritual journey.

**Abram's Great Longing for a Son**

- Abram's wife, Sarai, was barren. Genesis 11:30
- After Abram's encounter with Melchizedek, the LORD speaks to him in a vision and says, *“Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield and your very great reward.”* **Genesis 15:1**
- Abram complains, *“O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”* **Genesis 15:2**
- Then God gives one of the most important revelations in the Bible: *“Then the word of the LORD came to him: 'This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.' He took him outside and said, 'Look up at the sky and count the stars – if indeed you can count them.' Then he said to him, 'So shall your offspring be.' Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.”* **Genesis 15:4-6**
- The LORD reveals the great truth that He credits righteousness for faith.
- Abram's faith – God could do, would do, what He promised and give his greatest
desire: children.

**Unique Covenantal Sacrifice**

- God instructs Abram to offer this unique sacrifice in which God commits himself to
the fulfillment of His promises.
- The dividing of each sacrifice in half with the *“smoking firepot with a blazing torch,”* passing between **(Genesis 15:17)** signifies that the LORD alone passes between the pieces, Abram has fallen asleep.
- God reveals the unfailing nature of His promise.
- The seriousness of this type of sacrifice is seen in **Jeremiah 34:17-19**.
- In **Genesis 15:12-16**, the LORD covenants with Abram that his descendants, after a 400-year sojourn in a strange land, will return and possess the land of Canaan.

**Abram's Impatience to Have Children**

- Genesis 16 sadly relates Abram's impatience for a son as he, at Sarai's suggestion, fathers a son through her servant, Hagar.
- This failure has had far-reaching consequences even today in the bloody Middle East tensions between the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael.
- Abram's sin is instructive concerning God's purpose for marriage. God's promise was to Abram and his wife, not to Abram alone.

**God Confirms His Covenant After Thirteen Years**

- The LORD again appears to 99-year-old Abram. **Genesis 17:1**
- Genesis 17 gives the actual Abrahamic Covenant, the legal confirmation of the covenant in Genesis 15.
- The word *“covenant”* appears 14 times in Genesis 17, which reads like an official document.
- Abram's name means *“exalted father.”* God Almighty renames him Abraham which means *“father of many.”*
- God re-confirms that Abraham’s descendants will possess the whole land of Canaan.
- God institutes circumcision at this time as a sign of the covenant.
- Sarai *"My princess"* also receives a new name – Sarah which means *“Princess, Noblewoman”*.
- God states that Abraham and Sarah would have a son *“by this time next year.”* **Genesis 17:21**

**The LORD Appears to Abraham in Genesis 18**

- This appearance is a true theophany – an Old Testament appearance of Jesus.
- The second person of the Trinity is the visible manifestation of the invisible God.
- The LORD visiting Abraham, accompanied by two angels, is He who will be called Jesus. **Genesis 18:2**
- The first part of their conversation concerns the promise of a son, to be called
Isaac, meaning *“he who laughs.”*
- The second part of their conversation has Abraham bargaining with *“the Judge of all the earth,”* **Genesis 18:25** for Sodom. No doubt the safety of his nephew, Lot was foremost in his mind.

**Events Between the LORD's Visit and the Birth of Isaac**

- The events in Genesis 19 deal with Lot and his family who live in Sodom, the angels visit to Lot in Sodom and the destruction of Sodom.
- The sordid tale of Lot and his daughters is a final comment on the sad consequences of the infamous immorality of Sodom.
- Abraham, *“the father of all who believe”* **(Romans 4:11)**, does not stand out as one strong in faith in Genesis 20 and 21, but God protects him and his long hoped-for son is born.
- This promised son would carry the blessing that would lead to the Promised Son through whom *“all peoples on earth will be blessed.”* **Genesis 12:3**

**Jesus in the Life of Abraham**

- Scripture tells us in John 1:1 that Jesus is the Word of God. When God speaks, as He did to Abraham, we know that Jesus is present.
- In the revealed nature of God, all that God is must be present.
- In the theophany of Genesis 18, the visible manifestation of the invisible God must be our Lord Jesus Himself.
- In Abraham's longing for a son, we sense God's intense love for His eternal Son who will be the Son of Abraham, in whom all of the promises of God are fulfilled.

**Review**

- The LORD chooses to bless one man and his wife through whom blessing comes to all the peoples of the earth.
- This man, Abram, believing God, goes on a life-long journey of faith looking for a city *“whose architect and builder is God.”* **Hebrews 11:10**
- God credits righteousness to Abram's faith and Scripture assures us that this is available to all who believe His promises.
- Abram's longing for a son was fulfilled in Isaac.
- In Paul's letter to the Galatians, he points out, in reference to God's promise to give Abraham a son, *“The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say 'and to seeds,' meaning many people, but 'and to your seed,'  meaning one person, who is Christ.”* **Galatians 3:16**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will closely examine the story of Abraham’s offering of Isaac from three different perspectives.
