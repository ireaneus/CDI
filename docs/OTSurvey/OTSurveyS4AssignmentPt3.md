## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.112)*

You will KNOW:

- The generations from Noah to Abraham.
- Some crucial events during this time period which explain much in our world today.
- From Noah, the families of earth were divided in the lines of his three sons.

You will be ABLE TO:

- Understand that at the Tower of Babel, nationalities were originally separated as
language groups rather than *“races.”*
- Understand the declining ages of people.
- God's choosing of a particular man and his descendants through which *“all peoples on earth will be blessed.”* **Genesis 12:3b**
- Understand that the Flood is the best explanation for the Ice Age and place it on
the Bible timeline.

You will THINK ABOUT:

- From Creation to Abraham is just halfway through the 4,000 years of history from
Genesis to Malachi.

**In the Previous Session**

- Genesis 6-9 is referred to in Scripture as an actual and historical event.
- The Lord Jesus is typified both by Noah and the Ark.
- The Flood is the best explanation for the continents and landforms of today.
- Because one man found *“favor”* in God's sight (Genesis 6:8), mankind was spared
annihilation.
- Biblical understanding of the Flood is powerful testimony pointing to the grace and salvation found in *“the man, Christ Jesus.”* **1 Timothy 2:5b**

**The Flood Ends**

- The idea of separate “races” of people does not come from a proper understanding
of Scripture.
- From Noah, the families of the earth were divided in the lines of his three sons.
- Nationalities of our modern world were originally separated as language groups at
the Tower of Babel.
- The Flood left behind a world radically different from before the Flood.
- Noah's first action was to build an altar to the Lord.
- The Lord promises: *“never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.”* **Genesis 8:21-22**

**Introduction to the Noahic Covenant**

- The first recorded *“covenant”* in the Bible is in **Genesis 9:1-17.**
    - God's instructions to Adam are sometimes referred to as the *“Adamic Covenant”*,but a better description of this would be the *“Dominion Mandate”* as no elements of a typical covenantal agreement are present.
- God commanded Noah and his descendants to *“Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.”* **Genesis 9:1**
- Before the Flood, man and animals were vegetarian, but after the Flood, the Lord
said, *“Everything that lives and moves will be food for you.”* **Genesis 9:3**
- God also commanded, *“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.”* **Genesis 9:4**
- The Lord instituted human government when He said, *“And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each man too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man. Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.”* **Genesis 9:5-6**

**The Noahic Covenant – Genesis 9:8-17**

- *“Covenant”* appears *eight times* in this passage.
- God stated that this covenant is with Noah, his descendants and with *“every creature that was with you...all those that came out of the Ark with you.”* **Genesis 9:8-10**
- God promised, *“Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”* **Genesis 9:11**
- The *“sign”* of the covenant is *“My rainbow in the clouds”* **Genesis 9:13** (Actual word is *“bow”*, but is generally accepted as rainbow.)
- The rainbow appears so that God will see it and remember the covenant and *“Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.”* **Genesis 9:15**
- Some use this passage along with **Genesis 2:6** (*”Streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground…”*) to say that it hadn't rained until the Flood, but this is not absolutely certain.
- God making a *“covenant”* with Noah is significant: no conditions were placed upon Noah or his family.
- It is simply a binding agreement that God made stating his intentions. He chose
to commit Himself to this and Noah and all who came after him benefit from it.
- God is willing to make promises by which His faithful nature may be proved.
- The Noahic Covenant is still in effect.

**Genealogies and the “Table of Nations”**

- The tragic scene and consequences of **Genesis 9:18ff** lead to chapter 10 termed
*“The Table of Nations.”*
- After the Flood, by Bill Cooper, is a careful examination of the reliability of these genealogies.
- Mr. Cooper has excellent research documenting verifiable connections from Europe's ruling families all the way back to Noah and his sons.
- Genealogies are important in Scripture:
    - They give an accurate sense of the passage of time in early history.
    - They reveal the unity of mankind as one race descended from Adam.
    - They give a trustworthy sense of various family groups that branch out from the event of Babel.
- In the New Testament genealogies of Matthew and Luke, God identified the promised offspring from Eve who would *“crush the serpent's head”* and would identify Jesus with mankind whom He created in His own image.
- Pay particular attention to Peleg, the fifth generation from Noah. *“In his time  the earth was divided.”* **(Genesis 10:25)** This is a reference to the divisions of language groups at Babel.
- Genesis 10 traces Noah's descendants only for three to five generations.

**From Noah to the Tower of Babel**

- Genesis 11 begins, *“Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.”* **Genesis 11:1-2**
- Because of the issue of Noah's *“curse”* **(Genesis 9:25)**, against *Ham and Ham's son Canaan*, we can say there is *“disharmony”* in Noah's family.
- Three main family lines of descent appear and are fairly well recognized.
- Nimrod, Noah's great-grandson, through Ham, is prominent and concerning.
- Nimrod *“grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth”* and *“a mighty hunter before the Lord.”* **Genesis 10:8-9**
- The first center of Nimrod's kingdom was Babylon, and it is here that begins the long history of man's concerted rebellion against God which is finally culminated  in **Revelation 17.**

**Mankind's Continued Disobedience to God**

- The Lord's instructions to Noah and his family were to *“increase in number and fill the earth.”* **Genesis 9:1**
- It appears that they chose rather to remain together and *“build [themselves] a
city.”* **Genesis 11:4**
- Their intentions oppose God's command to *“fill the earth.”* **Genesis 9:1**
- They desired to *“not be scattered over the face of the earth.”* **Genesis 11:4**
- Their desire to build a *“tower that reaches to the heavens”* (v.4) is recognized as an early attempt at man-made religion.
- This may have been a hint of man's distrust of God's promise to never again flood the earth.

**The Lord's Brilliant Solution**

- *“But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.The LORD said, 'If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.' So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.”* **Genesis 11:5-8**
- The confusion of languages at Babel is the best explanation for the differing
peoples of the earth.
- Various language groups spread out of Babel becoming separate *“genetic pools”*
with each one developing physical features including skin coloration.
- All are descended from Adam through Noah. There is only one human race. Jesus and the Confusion of Languages
- The Lord's choice of words in **Genesis 11:7**, *“Let US go down and confuse their language”* (emphasis added) is an early *“hint”* of what would be progressively revealed of the triune nature of God.
- We see testimony of the Lord Jesus as we recognize His presence in this crucial
moment of earth history.
- He who divided people into what would become the nations of the earth, is the
same one who would say, *“Go and make disciples of all nations.”* **Matthew 28:19**
and *“...you will be My witnesses...to the ends of the earth.”* **Acts 1:8**

**Years Following the Flood**

- The earth experienced dramatic changes. There are many evidences of what we
now call the *“Ice Age.”*
- The Ice Age likely began and ended within 500 years following the flood.
- Recommended reading: Frozen in Time: The Wooly Mammoth, the Ice Age and the Bible. By Michael Oard.

**Narrative of One Particular Lineage**

- From this point in Scripture we see a “focusing” on one particular lineage.
- **Genesis 11:10-32** is a complete list of the descendants of Noah's son Shem through nine generations to Abraham.
- The list clearly shows a shortening of the life-spans of these descendants, most likely caused by the dramatic changes to the earth following the Flood and the probable degrading of humankind at the genetic level.

**Review**

- We saw the generations from Noah to Abraham.
- Mankind, even though refined by the judgment of the Flood, still tends toward disobedience and brokenness.
- Genesis 10 is a reliable early record of the sons of Noah who would become
nations of the earth.
- The events at Babel are a reasonable explanation for various language groups existing today as well as for the unique physical characteristics of the different nationalities.
- The narrative of Scripture focuses attention on one specific lineage from Noah to Abraham.
- Great ages of the pre-Flood people begin to diminish after the Flood.
- We have covered the time period from the fall of Adam to Abraham.
- Of the approximately 4,000 years of history recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures, the life of Abraham comes near the middle, around 2100 BC.

**Preview of the Next Session**
