**Begin video.**

**In the Previous Session**

- We looked at the tremendous events at Mt. Sinai where God Himself met with Moses and the Israelites and gave them the Law.
- The Law is much more than the Ten Commandments, comprising related moral, civil and religious regulations that reveal God’s righteousness and were meant to lead us to Christ.
- The Law also included careful instructions for the building of a uniquely furnished place where God would meet with His people.
- The tribe of Levi was set apart as priests to perform duties of the *“tent of meeting.”*
- Every detail of the Law, the tabernacle and the priesthood testify about Jesus.

**Preview**

- We will look at the remaining three books of the Pentateuch: Leviticus, Numbers
and Deuteronomy.
- It was pointed out at the end of the last session that Leviticus, as the name implies, deals with the duties of the tribe of Levi, particularly in regard to the sacrifices and offerings at the tabernacle, instructions about annual feasts and additional civil regulations.
- The book of Numbers spans the 40 years of the Israelites’ wandering in the
wilderness because of their failure to trust the LORD when they first came to the
Promised Land.
- The book of Deuteronomy contains a second listing of the Ten Commandments and Moses’ final words of encouragement and warning to his people before his death.

**The Difficult Book of Leviticus**

- Leviticus is the shortest book in the Pentateuch.
- The first seven chapters describe, in detail, five types of offerings that were to be presented at the Tabernacle.
- These seem so far removed from the experience of a contemporary follower of Jesus that many turn away from the attempt to learn about Him in the Old Testament because of the bloody sacrifices of Leviticus.
- Blood sacrifice is the requirement of God for the removal of the penalty of sin and is the consistent message of all of Scripture.
- The sacrificial system was the solution to the revelation of our unrighteousness by the coming of the Law.
- The sacrifices speak of and point to one perfect Sacrifice that would answer every
need of the repenting believer.

**Five Offerings Listed at the Beginning of Leviticus**

- These point toward and are fulfilled by the one sacrifice of the “Lamb of God:”
    - The burnt offering
    - The grain offering
    - The fellowship offering
    - The sin offering
    - The guilt offering
- It is not necessary to examine the bloody details of these offerings but we must note their significance in relation to what Jesus’ death accomplished.

**The Burnt Offering**

- **Leviticus 1:1-17; 6:8-13**.
- The outstanding characteristic of this offering is that it is to be entirely burned up; no part is left over for any other purpose.
- It speaks of the wrath of God against sin and of how completely Jesus accomplished his Father’s will.
- **2 Corinthians 5:21** says, *“God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us.”*

**The Grain Offering**

- **Leviticus 2:1-16; 6:14-23.**
- Only a portion of this offering is to be burned; the rest belongs to the priests for their use.
- As with all offerings, only the best is to be presented to the LORD.
- No yeast is to be present and it is to be mixed with incense.
- The Biblical themes seen here and that speak of “the Bread of Life”, are His purity and His ministry as our Great High Priest.

**The Fellowship Offering – Traditionally Called the Peace Offering**

- **Leviticus 3:1-17; 7:11-21.**
- In **Leviticus 7:12**, we read, *“If he offers it as an expression of  thankfulness...”*
- Of all the themes in Scripture, this theme of fellowship or *“peace with God”*, may be one of the greatest.
- From that which was lost in the Garden to the ultimate fulfillment of **Revelation 21:3**: *“Now the dwelling of God is with men”*, our deepest need is met through the sacrifice of Jesus. *“He Himself is our peace.”* **Ephesians 2:14**

**The Sin Offering**

- **Leviticus 4:1-5:13.**
- One notable characteristic is the phrase, *“When anyone sins unintentionally… when he is made aware of the sin.”* cf. **Leviticus 4:2, 13-14, 22-23, 27-28**
- Much in this offering speaks of the grace of God.
- We are immediately reminded of **Romans 5:8**: *“But God demonstrated His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”*

**The Guilt Offering**

- **Leviticus 5:14-6:7; 7:1-10.**
- The guilt offering and sin offering are similar with the main difference being the requiring of restitution for offenses associated with the guilt offering.
- The sin offering admits of an offense against God.
- The guilt offering confesses the same before men.

**Leviticus 8-15**

- This section primarily deals with the ordination of Aaron and his sons to serve as priests and their duties regarding purification for certain types of uncleanness.
- The account of the death of Aaron’s two eldest sons in chapter 10 emphasizes the serious responsibility of the priesthood.
- Various civil laws concerning what is clean and unclean reflect the holiness of God fulfilled eventually and perfectly in Jesus.

**The Day of Atonement**

- **Leviticus 16.**
- This particular holy day deserves special notice.
- It was designed to be an annual day of sacrifice that would cover all the sins of
the people.
- This was the only day of the year that the High Priest could enter the Holy of Holies and sprinkle the blood of atonement, or “covering”, on the Mercy Seat that covered the Ark of the Covenant.
- The significance of this tremendous picture of Christ’s sacrifice is clarified in
Hebrews 9 and 10.
- The shed blood of Jesus accomplished completely what was only pictured in the annual Day of Atonement.

**Seven Primary “Appointed Feasts”**

- Following more listings of *“clean and unclean”* foods and behaviors, Leviticus ends with a review of the seven primary *“appointed feasts.”* **Leviticus 23:2**
- Besides the Sabbath, these feasts are:
    - Feast of Unleavened Bread, Passover and the Feast of First fruits – in the first month.
    - Feast of Weeks – fifty days after the First fruits.
    - Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement and Feast of Tabernacles – all in the seventh month.
- The first three feasts were to commemorate the events of the Exodus. Each one pointed to and revealed the Messiah.
- The Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Passover were fulfilled in the Sinless Lamb.
- The Feast of First fruits was fulfilled in Christ’s resurrection.
- The Feast of Weeks was fulfilled at Pentecost when Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to indwell and empower the disciples.
- The Day of Atonement was also fulfilled at the Cross.
- The Feast of Trumpets and the Feast of Tabernacles are to be fulfilled when Christ returns.

**The Book of Numbers – Chapters 1-4**

- Much of this fourth book of the Law involves counting.
- In the first chapter, the Israelites are *“numbered”* by their tribal divisions. All males were counted *“twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army.”* **Numbers 1:3**
- The elderly may not have been counted.
- The final count was 603,550.
- We are not given the number of women and children, estimating at least one female and two children per man, the total number of Israelites at this time was about 2 million.
- The Levites were counted separate from the other tribes in Numbers 3 and 4.
- Directions for how the tribes were to set out on their journey are given in  Chapter 2.

**The Book of Numbers – Chapters 13–15**

- In Chapter 13, the Israelites arrive at the southern border of the Promised Land
and twelve men, one from each tribe, are sent to explore.
- Although the people have personally seen God’s power in their deliverance from Egypt and in His daily provisions, they rebel.
- Ten of the “spies” bring back a false report about the land and its dangers. Only
Joshua and Caleb remain faithful.
- As a result, the Israelites are turned back and for 40 years wander in the desert
until all that generation dies – except Joshua and Caleb.
- Those 40 years occur between the end of chapter 14 and the beginning of chapter 15.
- **Psalm 95 and Hebrews 4**, look back to this time of unbelief of Israel when they
*“hardened their hearts”* and failed to enter their promised *“rest.”*
- Jesus himself is the fulfillment of this place of rest, *“for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from his own work.”* **Hebrews 4:10; Matthew 11:28-30**

**The Remaining Chapters of Numbers**

- The rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram and the confirmation of the Aaronic,priesthood are covered in chapters 16 through 18.
- Moses and Aaron’s failure when they strike the rock in chapter 20 lead to their
being excluded from entering the land.
- The event of the bronze serpent that Jesus refers to in **John 3:14-15** is recorded in **Numbers 21:4-9.**
- The account of Balaam is in chapters 22 through 25.
- Balaam’s prophecy, *“A star will come out of Jacob,”* **(Numbers 24:17)** is likely that which led the magi to seek the newborn Christ.
- In Numbers 26, after 40 years of wandering, the next generation of Israelites is
*“numbered”* by tribes.
- There are 601,730 males *“twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army.”* **Numbers 26:2**
- Numbers 28 and 29 describe various daily, Sabbath and monthly offerings along with a recounting of the yearly feasts that must be observed.
- Because each offering and feast points to Jesus, we are reminded, in the daily morning and evening sacrifices to thank God daily for the Lamb of God.
- Numbers 32 tells of the two and a half tribes that choose to stay east of the Jordan and not enter the Promised Land.
- Numbers concludes with a recounting of the stages of the Israelite journey and an
encouraging look forward to the dividing up of the land they are about to enter.

**Deuteronomy – The Final Book of the Pentateuch**

- Deuteronomy means *“Second Law.”*
- These laws are not different from the commands in Exodus; Deuteronomy retells the core laws to this generation as they prepare to enter the land.
- This book is, in essence, Moses’ final words to his people, reminding them of God’s Laws, promises and warnings.
- There are five *“speeches”* of Moses in Deuteronomy.
- Moses’ first speech is prefaced in Deuteronomy 1:5 and begins in verse 6 and
ends in chapter 4:40.
- The second speech is the longest.
- A fascinating fact from Deuteronomy is that, when Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness, Jesus quoted exclusively from Deuteronomy. Jesus successfully resisted the temptation that Adam had failed in the garden.
- Through faith in Jesus, the *“last Adam”* **(1 Corinthians 15:45)**, we may enter His rest now and forever.

**Deuteronomy Ends**

- Moses reminds the Israelites of the blessings of obeying God and the terrible consequences of disobedience. He then yields his leadership to Joshua.
- *“Moses was faithful in all God’s house.”* **Hebrews 3:2**
- God spoke with him *“face to face, as a man speaks with his friend.”* **Exodus 33:11;** cf. **Deuteronomy 34:10**
- He is rightly honored as a great prophet, **(Deuteronomy 18:15; 34:10)**, a servant of God, **(Joshua 1:1,2)**, and *“a very humble man.”* **Numbers 12:3**
- From his birth, to his exile, to his servant leadership, Moses typifies Jesus.
- He was prepared by God to be the author of the foundational books of the Bible.

**Review**

- The Pentateuch contains the God-breathed account of the supernatural creation of heaven and earth and the only trustworthy history of the beginnings of mankind and of this planet Earth.
- From Genesis 12 on, we read of God’s choosing one man and that from his descendants He would bring the Savior to bless all nations and undo the curse of sin and death.
- None of the rest of the Hebrew Scriptures, or of the New Testament, or of the ministry of God the Son, would be possible to understand without the foundational truths of the books of Moses.
- The student of Scripture would do well to spend much time in *“the Law”* if he would truly understand grace.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at the next great division of the Hebrew Scriptures, *“the Nevi’im”*, or *“the Prophets.”*

## Key Verses

## Class Exercise

Simply reading through Deuteronomy there are some obvious extended speeches and some not so obvious shorter ones. Speech titles appear in italics.

1. From Deuteronomy 1:6–4:40, though the subject may change I don’t see any break where Moses stops and starts up again. I consider this one speech: Moses Reviews the Past.
2. Moses’ second speech begins in chapter 5, verse 1 and goes all the way through the end of chapter 26. I agree with there being a number of different topics, but I do not find any place where Moses could be said to have stopped: What the LORD Expects.
3. “Moses and the elders” (27:1), speak to the people in 27:1-10, but Moses’ third speech begins at 27:12 and goes through 28:68: Blessings and Curses.
4. Moses’ fourth speech begins at Deuteronomy 29:2 and goes through 30:20: The Covenant Renewed. I don’t really consider Deuteronomy 31:2-8 a “speech” in the sense of an extended discourse. This is more of some intermediate instructions. The
LORD speaks to Moses and then Joshua in Deuteronomy 31:14-23 and then Moses speaks to the Levites in Deuteronomy 31:24-29. I also do not include the “Song of Moses” in chapter 32 as one of his “speeches.”
5. Moses’ fifth speech is in chapter 33 where he blesses the tribes of Israel: The Final Blessing.
