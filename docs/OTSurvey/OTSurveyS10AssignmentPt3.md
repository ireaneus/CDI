**Review of the Last Session**

- We scanned the 3 prophets *Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah*
- They all ministered between the fall of Samaria in 722 BC and the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC.
- Nahum prophesied against Nineveh which was destroyed in 612 BC.
- Habakkuk complained to the LORD about the violence and injustice in the land. He had a hard time understanding how God would use wicked Babylonians as his instruments of judgment.
- Zephaniah, a descendant of King Hezekiah, foresaw the destruction of Jerusalem. His ministry was during the reign of Josiah, Judah’s last good king.
- *Isaiah, Jeremiah, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah* warned about the consequences of disobeying God.
- In Jeremiah’s writings, Jerusalem was destroyed and her people taken captive to Babylon because they refused to listen.
- The captivity lasted 70 years.
- At the end of that time, as Jeremiah had foretold, (**Jeremiah 25:11; 29:10**), the people were allowed to return to their land.
- As Isaiah had foretold (**Isaiah 44:28; 45:13**), *King Cyrus* would release the captives and they would return to rebuild Jerusalem and the Temple.
- Ezra related more history of this time of rebuilding and will be covered, along with Nehemiah, in session 13.

**Preview**

- The prophets Haggai and Zechariah were among those returning to Jerusalem, sent by the LORD to encourage the people in the task of rebuilding.
- Haggai and Zechariah are mentioned by Ezra in his records.
- Malachi’s ministry was years later after the Temple had been completed.

**Haggai and Zechariah Timeline Background**

- Haggai and Zechariah clearly state the time of their ministry during the reign of *Darius*. **Haggai 1:1** and **Zechariah 1:1**.
- This Darius was the first of three rulers of Persia with that name.
- The four messages of Haggai, are clearly marked with the month and day on which they were given.
- *Darius I* reigned from 521 BC to 486 BC so his second year was 520 BC.
- *“The first day of the sixth month,”* (**Haggai 1:1**) according to the Jewish calendar, was the New Moon Festival Elul (August/September).
- Note: If your Bible doesn’t identify these messages, it would be simple to do so yourself.

**Haggai’s Messages**

- The simple theme of Haggai is that the people, now returned from exile and tasked with rebuilding the temple, should keep at it.
- Ezra explains the reasons why these people began to build, but then stopped.
- Haggai’s first message (**Haggai 1:2–11**) warns of the danger of putting their own comforts ahead of the priority of ministry. The rest of the chapter records the people’s response.
    - The LORD gave a word of encouragement to them: *“I am with you,” declares the LORD.* **Haggai 1:13**
    - Rebuilding resumed three weeks later, on the 24th day of that month.
- Haggai’s second message (**Haggai 2:1–9**) given on the 21st day of the 7th month. This was the seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles.
    - This message concerns the discouraging, unfavorable comparison of the rebuilt temple with the former glory of Solomon’s temple.
    - He told the people not to look back, but to look ahead for the coming of the Messiah, *“the desired of all nations.”* **Haggai 2:7**
    - This would be the greater glory of the new temple spoken of by Ezekiel and of the One who would come to dwell with His people.
- All of his messages took place in the year 520 BC between the 6th and 9th months.
- After the people returned to work on the Temple, the LORD promised them, *“From this day on I will bless you.”* **Haggai 2:19**

**Zechariah’s Ministry**

- Zechariah’s Ministry began between Haggai’s second and third messages, *“in the eighth month the second year of Darius.”* **Zechariah 1:1**
- Zechariah 1:1-6 is a historical review of just punishment that had fallen on the people’s ancestors.
- Zechariah’s first message comes in Zechariah 1:7.
    - Three months later he recounted a series of eight visions which bear strong resemblance to the last book of the New Testament.
    - The question/answer format of these visions, between Zechariah and an angel, increases our interest in the unfolding revelation.
    - These visions identify *Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, and Joshua, a descendant of Aaron*, as those chosen by the LORD to lead his people.
    - *Each of these men foreshadow Jesus who will be King and Priest, especially Joshua.*
    - At the conclusion of these visions, a crown was made for Joshua and the statement is made, *“He will be a priest on His throne, and there will be harmony between the two.”* (**Zechariah 6:13**) Only Jesus could fulfill both roles.
- Chapters 7-8 concern a question about true fasting and the LORD’s determination to bless His people. This occurs two years after Zechariah’s first vision.
- Chapters 9-11 and 12-14 are each an *“oracle,”* a *“burdened message”* from the LORD.
    - The first message foretold the first coming of the Messiah: *“Rejoice greatly, Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your King comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”* **Zechariah 9:9**
    - The second message foretold Jesus’ second coming and included a powerful prediction of Jesus’ death: *“Strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.”* **Zechariah 13:7**
    - Here also is found the true hope of Israel: *“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on Me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son. On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be great.”* **Zechariah 12:10, 11a**

[OTSurvey - The Twelve Zechariah](/OTSurvey/OTSurveyZechariah/)

**Malachi’s Messages**

- Malachi spoke to people who had finished building the Temple and had begun to offer sacrifices there. Malachi’s ministry is placed 70 years after the ministries of Haggai and Zechariah.
- Some of the content of Malachi indicates he was a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah.
- Ezra, when he wrote about Haggai and Zechariah, wrote a historical record.
- Malachi has one message that deals with several different topics.
- After the record of the response to his message, he concludes with the prophecy that Elijah will return before the day of the LORD.
- The question/answer method used by Zechariah and an angel is used by Malachi to engage his audience.
- Malachi is very direct in his challenging the selfish practices of his day.
- Malachi began by confirming that the LORD does indeed love His people. He does this by reminding them that they have been given another chance, but the sons of Esau have not.
- Because the LORD loves Jacob, his prophet must rebuke their waywardness.
- The first topic is the practice of sacrificing blemished animals instead of acceptable ones: *“Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the LORD. For I am a great king,” says the LORD Almighty, “and My name is to be feared among the nations.”* **Malachi 1:14**
- Next, Malachi speaks to the priests for showing *“partiality in matters of the law.”* **Malachi 2:9**
- No sacrifice could be made without them so the matter of offering blemished sacrifices would have fallen at their feet. In addition, they failed to lead the people in matters of faithfulness in God-ordained relationships. This is likely the same issue Ezra dealt with when the Israelites began marrying foreign wives. **Ezra 9-10**
- In this context the LORD also condemns divorce. *“‘I hate divorce,’ says the LORD God of Israel, ‘and I hate a man’s covering himself with violence as well as with his garment,’ says the LORD God Almighty.”* **Malachi 2:16**
- As Malachi then moves on to a warning of judgment on those who confuse good and evil, he gives the first hint of a messenger who will *“prepare the way”* for the LORD to come to his Temple. (**Malachi 3:1**) This prophecy is fully stated in Malachi’s concluding words in Chapter 4.
- His final rebuke concerns the neglect of tithes and offerings, which may be connected with the issue in **Nehemiah 13**, where Nehemiah records that Levites and others responsible for the Temple had left Jerusalem because they were neglected.
- The LORD makes a wonderful promise to those who would trust and obey him in this matter of giving: *“Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.”* **Malachi 3:10**
- Malachi ended with the promised return of *“the prophet Elijah”* who would *“turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers...”* and the warning, *“...or else I will come and strike the land with a curse.”* **Malachi 4:5-6**

**Review**

- We looked at the Minor Prophets in three groups:
    1. Six prophets before and during the time of the fall of Samaria in 722 BC.
    2. Three prophets in the time just before the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC.
    3. Three prophets to the Jews who had returned to the Promised Land following the Babylonian captivity.
- This is end of our journey through the part of the Tanakh called *“The Prophets”* – including: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and The Twelve.
- We also covered the **book of Chronicles** because, although the Hebrew Scriptures place it in *“The Writings,”* it was a parallel account of **2 Samuel and Kings**.
- Our final three sessions will cover what Jesus referred to as *“The Psalms.”*

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will cover the *book of Psalms*.
- We will see the LORD Jesus as He appears in the songs of the Hebrews.
- We will look for Him there as Poet, Savior and King.

## Class Exercise

**ASSIGNMENT: OUTLINE THE BOOK OF HAGGAI**

Be prepared to discuss the KNOW, ARE ABLE TO and WILL BE THINKING ABOUT statements from this session that appear at the beginning of this session in your guidebook.

Outline Haggai’s messages including their corresponding verses. When finished, take Mid-Term.  
**The first of Haggai’s four prophecies (Haggai 1:1–15) was delivered on the first day of the sixth month of the second year of Darius – about August-September, 520 BC This was addressed to the leaders, rebuking them for the spiritual lethargy which had allowed the Temple to lie unfinished for such a long time. Haggai cites this lethargy as a chief cause for God’s having withheld His blessings from the people (Haggai 1:6). Haggai’s words were so effective that it was only twenty-four days later that the work of rebuilding the Temple was begun.**

**Haggai’s second message (Haggai 2:1–9), was delivered about a month later (October), and was designed to encourage those who were despondent over the disparity in glory between the former Temple and the new one they were erecting. Haggai assured them that a greater glory than that of the past Temple was to come to the house of Israel. In this connection, he speaks of the *“desire of all nations”* (Haggai 2:7), referring to the Messiah.**

**Two months after the second message, Haggai spoke to the people for a third time. In this section (Haggai 2:10–19), Haggai informs the people that their past indifference had kept them from accomplishing the things which they set out to do but that God would bless their future.**

**The last message contained in the book was delivered the same day as the third and is found in **Haggai 2:20–23**. In this, the prophet speaks of the establishment of Zerubbabel, a symbol of the idea that God’s people were to stand, just as the power of the heathen nations was completely broken.**
