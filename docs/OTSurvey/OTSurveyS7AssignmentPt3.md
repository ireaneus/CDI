**Begin video.**

**In the Previous Session**

- Learned about Joshua and the conquest of the Promised Land.
- Looked at the Judges and at ways they revealed Jesus.

**Preview**

- 1 Samuel, Israel moves from the period of Judges to the time of Kings.
- Also tells of the last judge, Samuel and Israel’s first king, Saul.
- We are also introduced to David.

**The Little Book of Ruth**

- Story of Ruth takes place during the time of the Judges
- The book of Ruth is included in the third section of the Tanakh, the *“Writings.”*
- The story gives us a picture of a *“kinsman-redeemer.”*
- It reveals an important truth about the coming Savior who would come from the line of Boaz and Ruth who were grandparents of King David.

**Early Arrangement of Books of Samuel and Kings**

- 1 and 2 Samuel were originally one book.
- Some early collections, because of the unique subject matter of Samuel and Kings, divided the two books into 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 3 Kings and 4 Kings.
- In this survey, 1 Samuel will be studied as a transitional book from the time of the Judges to the time of the Kings.

**1 Samuel Divided Into Three Parts**

- First part, Chapters 1-8, covers the birth, call and ministry of Samuel, the last of the Judges.
- Second part, Chapters 9-15, introduces Israel’s first King, Saul.
- Third part, Chapters 16-31, introduces David who is chosen by the LORD to succeed Saul.
- To the end of the book the lives of Saul and David are woven together as Saul descends into madness and David ascends to eventual Kingship.

**Samuel’s Birth and Calling – Chapters 1-3**

- A picture of God’s grace in the final collapse of the system of the Judges.
- Like the story of Ruth, the account of Samuel’s family and birth is a glimpse of a more peaceful period near the end of the time of the Judges.
- From the fairly well-established time of the reigns of Saul and David, Samuel, who lived to be about 75 years old was likely alive during the judgeships of Jephthah and Samson.
- As with many great leaders in the Hebrew Scriptures, Samuel’s birth and early life were unique.
- His mother, Hannah, was a woman who suffered, was misunderstood and who demonstrated great faith.
    - Her prayer in **1 Samuel 2:1-10** reveals a mature knowledge of the ways of the LORD and great confidence in his power.
    - Eli the Priest and his wicked sons are a strong contrast to Hannah’s obedient trust.
    - That she would dedicate her longed-for firstborn son to the LORD, is testimony of her greater longing for God’s provision of a righteous Savior. 1 Samuel 2:10
- Samuel’s first encounter with the LORD in Chapter 3, is a glimpse of God’s gentleness and yet firm determination that his servants uphold his honor.
- In Chapters 4-8 we see Samuel’s increasing influence as the last Judge of Israel, leading his people back to the LORD and in victory over their enemies.

**The Latter Part of Samuel’s Life**

- In Chapter 8, the Israelites ask for a king. They say to Samuel, *“You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have.”* **1 Samuel 8:5**
- The LORD tells Samuel, *“Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.”* **1 Samuel 8:7**
- This desire of the people was not in line with the LORD’s purposes at that time and Samuel’s farewell speech in Chapter 12 addresses this.
- The Law made provision for a king (Deuteronomy 17:14-20), but he was to be *“the king the LORD your God chooses.”* **Deuteronomy 17:15**
- Saul was chosen as the first king and Samuel was directed by the LORD to anoint him.
- Saul stands as a prime example of the inadequacy of a merely human king, as do all the kings of Israel.

**The Story of Saul**

- From the very beginning, we sense a contrast between his outward appearance and the shortcomings of his character.
- He is a strong contrast to Israel’s second king, David – the one of whom the LORD would say, *“Man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”* **1 Samuel 16:7**
- Saul is also a contrast to the true King, Jesus, who would have *“nothing in his appearance that we should desire him”* **(Isaiah 53:2)**, yet whose heart was flawless.
- In the early years of Saul’s reign, we see encouraging signs of humility, obedience and boldness.
- The Spirit of the LORD comes upon him confirming his kingship (1 Samuel 10:6-7). Empowering him to lead the Israelites in battle. 1 Samuel 11:6
- In Chapter 13, when Saul oversteps his authority as king, Samuel rebukes him and tells him that his kingdom will end. Then he says, *“The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people.”* **1 Samuel 13:14**
- Saul’s flawed character is further revealed in Chapter 15, not only in his incomplete obedience, but in his dishonesty.
- In Samuel’s final rebuke of Saul, he declares, *“Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice.”* **1 Samuel 15:22**

**Jonathan, One Bright Spot in Saul’s Kingship**

- Chapter 14 tells of Saul’s valiant son, Jonathan.
- Jonathan stands out as a man of faith and courage and we also sense that he is a man of greater character than his father.
- We see the leaders of Saul’s army unwilling to harm Jonathan in direct disobedience to Saul.
- He will be an important person in the early years of David’s public life.
- He is a faithful friend who willingly relinquishes his natural right to the throne of Israel as he recognizes that God has chosen David to be Israel’s king.
- Jonathan pictures what our attitude should be in yielding to our rightful King.

**David Enters Saul’s Life**

- David is the youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem.
- He will become, in the Old Testament, Israel’s greatest king.
- David’s story is one the most important in the Hebrew Scriptures in preparing people to recognize the Son of David, Jesus.
- From his humble beginnings, he stands out as a loyal servant and mighty warrior.
- The story of David and Goliath, pictures a young man with great, bold faith who goes alone to uphold the honor the LORD.
- In the early years, David is a strong type of Jesus in his humility, loyalty, faithfulness and single-minded devotion to the LORD.
- From this point on the book of 1 Samuel revolves around Saul’s jealousy and David’s loyalty to *“the LORD’s anointed.”* **1 Samuel 24:6**
- Saul becomes increasingly obsessed with destroying his perceived adversary, but David continues to be faithful to his king and to his people.
- Strong contrasts between Saul and David, between David and his own followers, between righteousness and evil are woven through the adventures of Chapters 16 through 30.
- In all that happens to David, the strongest impression given is that God is with him in his trials and will not allow his enemy to overcome him.
- We will eventually read of David’s great failure, but in the years leading up to his kingship, David foreshadowed the perfect loyalty and obedience that will be found in the true Messiah.
- In David, we see an unjust persecution of a servant of God by the very people he has been anointed to serve and save.

**Review**

- We have seen, in Samuel, the last of Israel’s Judges and also a prophet of the LORD, warning God’s people and calling them to obedience.
- Samuel, like Jesus, was dedicated to God even before his conception and called by God from his youth.
- Much in Samuel’s life and ministry foreshadows the Lord Jesus as the rightful Judge and our true prophet.
- Saul, Israel’s first king, is an accurate picture of the weakness of earthly leaders. He looked good on the outside, but his character was flawed. He was corrupted by the power of kingship.
- Saul was a lesson to Israel that earthly kings could not be their true saviors.
- Saul prepared Israel for David’s better rule and for a Greater King whose character would be without blemish.
- We were introduced to David, the *“man after God’s own heart.”* **1 Samuel 13:14**
- We saw Saul’s decline and David’s rise and the obvious difference in their characters.
- Israel needed a righteous king, and so do we.
- David, with all his good qualities, would not be that righteous king either, but he brought more clearly into focus who that King would be.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- In our next session, we will look at David’s life more closely.
- Look at King David, his son Solomon and the kings that followed them and reigned over Israel. We will see how they did or did not prepare us for the arrival of the King of kings, Jesus.
