Begin video.

**Review of the Previous Session**

- We looked at the basics of Hebrew poetry.
- The same forms we saw in the Psalms are present in Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon.

**Preview**

- In this session we look at the book of Job.
- In Part 2 we will look at Proverbs and in Part 3 the books of Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon.
- These 4 books are often called the *“Wisdom Literature”* of the Bible.
- The Apostle Paul says, *“Christ Jesus…has become for us wisdom from God – that is our righteousness, holiness and redemption.”* **1 Corinthians 1:30**
- He also says, *“all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”* are hidden in Christ. **Colossians 2:3**
- In these books we will see Jesus revealed in the characters and discussions.

**Job: A Story of Suffering and Hard Questions**

- *“The patience of Job”* is proverbial, but may not be the best description of Job’s character.
- Job’s story is an ancient story.
- The opening two chapters set the stage for the discussions to follow and are mostly in prose.
- Throughout the book there are *“time stamps”* which indicate that Job lived around the time of Abraham.
- There is no mention of Moses or the Law or of Abraham and his descendants.
- In that sense Job was not in the line of the faith of Abraham, yet he is singled out by the LORD for his character.
- This is reason to pause and think about what faith looked like among the Gentiles without reference to the promises of God.

**Historical Background**

- *“Land of Uz”* (**Job 1:1**) is generally accepted as a reference to Uz, the great-grandson of Noah. **Genesis 10:23**
- The mention of Chaldean raiding parties, in **Job 1:17**, is a clue to placing this story on the Bible timeline. Abraham was from Chaldea. **Genesis 15:7**
- Mention of these raiders hints at a time before the development of the political structure that would become Babylon.
- Another timeline indicator: Eliphaz, the Temanite (**Job 2:11**), may be the same person listed in **Genesis 36:11**.
- That Eliphaz is the firstborn of Esau and his firstborn is named Teman.
- Although Job’s story is from the time of the Patriarchs, the written account is in the literary forms of the time of Solomon.
- Job’s story is not made up to teach a lesson. There is no sense that he was not a real person who suffered and met with God.
- The book of Job is an ancient story, handed down from the time of Abraham and written out in the time of Solomon using highly developed forms of Hebrew poetry.
- The author of Job did his research well and tells Job’s story from the viewpoint of an eyewitness.

**Chapter One**

- The intriguing and powerful drama begins.
- Job is introduced as *“blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.”* **Job 1:1**
- He had seven sons and three daughters and extensive property.
- He cared deeply about the moral and spiritual condition of these children.
- In the opening scene of the drama: The *“sons of God”* and the accuser, Satan, come before God. **Job 1:6-12**
- God opens the conversation and draws attention to his *“servant Job.”* **Job 1:8**
- Satan’s accusations lead God to give him permission to test Job.
- Job loses nearly everything. His response is worship:
    - *Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.*
    - In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
    - **Job 1:21-22**

**Chapter Two**

- We see a similar scene of confrontation between the LORD and Satan with a similar outcome.
- The LORD gives Satan permission to afflict Job, but not to take his life: *“So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.”* **Job 2:7**
- Notice that from this point on, Satan is irrelevant.
- Even Job’s wife encourages him to *“curse God and die!”* (**Job 2:9**), but Job remains faithful.
- Then the heart of the book of Job begins.
- Three of Job’s friends come to sympathize with him.
- They sit silently for seven days, then the discussions begin.
- **Job 3:1–42:6** are, for the most part, written in poetic form.

**Job’s Three Friends – Overview**

- Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite all attempt to discern the cause of Job’s suffering.
- Each one is unique and interesting in their viewpoints.
- Three “rounds” of discussion, with first Job and then each friend offering their thoughts.
    - Job responds to each friend’s suggestions and ends each round of talks with a longer discourse.
    - Round 1—**Job 3–14**
    - Round 2—**Job 15–21**
    - Round 3—**Job 22–31**
    - Zophar makes no statement in the third round.
    - Job ends each round with his own discourse.
- At the end of the third round, Job lays the case for his innocence before the LORD and waits for a response.

**Round One Discussion**

- Job begins the first discussion in Chapter 5, by cursing the day of his birth.
- He wishes he had never been born only to know such suffering.
- At first he only suggests that God is distant.
- Eliphaz’ reply in **Job 4–5**, reveals him to be religious but unsympathetic.
    - He believes suffering is brought on those who sin: *“As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.”* **Job 4:8**
- He counsels Job to accept his suffering as discipline for sin.
- Job rejects Eliphaz’ counsel saying, *“I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.”* (**Job 6:7**) Job begins to cry out to God for meaning.
- One of the most important lessons from Job is that his friends only talk about God, but Job cries out to God.
- Bildad enters the conversation in chapter 8.
    - He is more harsh than Eliphaz, claiming that Job’s children died because of their sin. **Job 8:4**
    - He states boldly that God would never allow such suffering on *“a blameless man.”* **Job 8:20**
- Job’s reply is profound: *“How can a mortal man be righteous before God?”* **Job 9:2**
    - Is the question of suffering even connected to the question of blamelessness?
    - Job’s mention of the great power of God as *“the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south,”* (**Job 9:9**), shows a highly developed awareness of the natural world.
    - In this discourse, Job begins to cry for *“someone to arbitrate between”* himself and God. **Job 9:33**
    - He remains in despair, overcome by his pain.
- Zophar speaks in Chapter 11.
    - He reveals an impatience toward Job.
    - He says Job’s complaints are *“idle talk”* (**Job 11:3**), mocking, in need of rebuke.
- Job’s reply is classic: *“Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!”* **Job 12:1**
    - Later he addresses all three with: *“You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!”* **Job 13:4**
    - Yet he cries out about God: *“Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him!”* **Job 13:15**
    - He closes his discussion with one of the great statements of his faith: *“All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.”* **Job 14:14**

**The Next Two Rounds of Discussion**

- Each friend maintains his character and position, but Job was learning.
- To Eliphaz, he says, *“Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high. My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God; on behalf of a man He pleads with God as one pleads for a friend.”* **Job 16:19–21**
- In his response to Bildad’s harsh words Job comes to an even greater realization:
    - *“I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!"* **Job 19:25-27**
- Job presents his closing argument in chapters 26–31.
- His words are eloquent but his conclusion is to justify himself and ends with: *“Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.”* **Job 31:35**

**The Mysterious Elihu – Job 32–37**

- Elihu was apparently present all along, but hesitant to speak because of his youth. **Job 32:6**
- He has been listening closely.
- He quotes Job’s words and answers his arguments as though he was speaking for God.
- He becomes very bold in Job 36: *“I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker. Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.”* **Job 36:3–4**
- Elihu was not included as God confronts Job’s 3 friends, saying they have *“not spoken of Me what is right.”* **Job 42:7**
- Elihu likened an approaching storm to the approach of God and, in fact, God does come to speak with Job out of the storm.
- Job’s three friends talked *about* God, Job talks *to* God, but Elihu brings God *into* the conversation.

**God Speaks**

- In chapters 38–42, the LORD *“answered Job out of the storm.”* **Job 38:1**
- God does not answer Job’s complaints – He asks him questions.
- Instructor’s Notes: When life has overwhelmed me, reading Job 38–42 has put things in perspective.
- God, the Creator, speaks with Job and we have seen that the Creator of heaven and earth is Jesus.
- In chapters 38–39, God asked Job to consider the wonders of the natural world and Job is silenced.
- In chapters 40–41, the LORD asks Job to consider the mightiest creatures of land and sea.
- In Job 40:15–24, God described what must have been a dinosaur.
- Job is overwhelmed, not by these animals, but by the God who made them.
- In Job 41, God describes a fearsome sea creature that Job was familiar with.
- Job is humbled at these glimpses of the creation of Almighty God.

**The Outcome of Job**

- In the end, Job intercedes for his friends who did not speak what is right about God. **Job 42:8**
- He is doubly blessed with possessions and children and a long life.

**The Message of Job**

- Job is a type of Jesus, who also *“learned obedience from what He suffered.”* **Hebrews 5:8**
- The message of Job is not the question so often asked, *“Why do the righteous suffer?”* The message is: There is only one *“Righteous One”* (**Isaiah 24:16**), and he suffered more than anyone ever has or could.
- Jesus never sinned, but suffered for our sins.
- Jesus is the Advocate and Intercessor and Friend and Redeemer that Job longed for; who *“did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”* **Mark 2:17**

**Review**

- The suffering of believing saints throughout history is the story of faith and Job was an early pioneer.
- Jesus did say, *“In this world you will have trouble, but take heart! I have overcome the world.”* **John 16:33**
- *We ought to be like Elihu, bringing God into the conversation of this suffering world!*

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at the book of Proverbs.

### **Key Observations for Your Character Study**

- Elihu is **never rebuked by God** (unlike Job’s three friends — **Job 42:7**).
- Elihu consistently **defends God’s righteousness**, not himself.
- Elihu introduces themes that **God immediately expands on** in Job 38–41.
- Elihu functions as a **theological bridge**:

  - Friends → talk *about* God
  - Job → talks *to* God
  - **Elihu → brings God *into* the conversation**

## **How Elihu Foreshadows Christ as Mediator**

Elihu does not replace Job or speak *instead* of God — he **stands between**, preparing the way for God to speak. In this role, he **foreshadows the true Mediator**, Jesus Christ.

### **1. Elihu Speaks *For* God, Not About God**

Job’s three friends talk *about* God.
Job cries *to* God.
**Elihu speaks *for* God.**

- **Job 33:2–3**

  > “My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.”

Elihu claims no personal righteousness — he speaks truth **on God’s behalf**, just as Christ speaks only what the Father gives Him.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **John 12:49** – “I did not speak on My own authority…”

### **2. Elihu Stands on Equal Ground With Job**

Elihu does something radical: he removes fear.

- **Job 33:6–7**

  > “I too have been formed out of clay… No fear of me should terrify you.”

He approaches Job **as one like him**, not above him.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **Hebrews 4:15** – Christ sympathizes with our weakness
- **Philippians 2:6–8** – Christ humbled Himself, taking human form

### **3. Elihu Introduces the Need for a Mediator**

Elihu explicitly raises the idea of mediation — something Job longs for earlier (Job 9:33).

- **Job 33:23–24**

  > “If there is a messenger for him, a mediator, one out of a thousand… then God is gracious…”

This is the **clearest mediator language in Job**.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **1 Timothy 2:5** – “There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus”

### **4. Elihu Explains Suffering as Redemptive, Not Punitive**

Unlike the friends, Elihu says suffering can be **instruction**, not judgment.

- **Job 33:29–30**

  > “God does all these things… to bring back his soul from the pit.”

This prepares the way for understanding the cross — suffering that saves.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **Hebrews 5:8** – “Although He was a Son, He learned obedience through suffering”

### **5. Elihu Defends God’s Justice Without Condemning Job**

Elihu corrects Job **without crushing him**.

- **Job 34:10–12**
  God is just, but Elihu never declares Job guilty.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **Romans 8:1** – “There is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus”

### **6. Elihu Prepares the Way for God’s Appearing**

Elihu’s final words describe a coming storm — then God speaks.

- **Job 37:1–5** → **Job 38:1**

  > “Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm…”

Elihu **decreases**, and God **increases**.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **John 3:30** – “He must increase, I must decrease”
- **Hebrews 1:1–2** – God now speaks through His Son

### **7. Elihu Is Not Rebuked by God**

God rebukes the three friends (**Job 42:7**).
**Elihu is not mentioned at all.**

This silence is significant — Elihu spoke rightly.

**Christ Fulfillment:**

- **Matthew 3:17** – “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”

## **Summary: Elihu as a Christ-Type (Not Christ)**

| Elihu                         | Christ               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Speaks for God                | Is the Word of God   |
| Stands with humanity          | Became fully human   |
| Introduces mediation          | Is the only Mediator |
| Explains redemptive suffering | Suffers to redeem    |
| Prepares way for God’s voice  | Is God’s final Word  |

---

### **Key Teaching Sentence**

> Elihu does not save Job — but he **points to the kind of mediator Job needs**, a role fulfilled perfectly in Jesus Christ.
