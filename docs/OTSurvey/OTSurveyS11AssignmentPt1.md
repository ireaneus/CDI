**Begin video.**

**Review of the Previous Session**

- We looked at the book of *“The Twelve”* or *“Minor Prophets.”*
- Divided into three groups:
    - *Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah and Micah* ministered before and during the fall of Samaria in **722 BC**.
    - Second group: *Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah* were contemporaries of Jeremiah prior to the fall of Jerusalem in **586 BC**.
    - *Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi* were sent by the LORD to encourage Jews returning to the Promised Land after the Babylonian captivity.

**Jesus in the Scriptures**

- The third division of the Tanakh, *“The Writings,”* or as Jesus called them in **Luke 24:44**, *“the Psalms.”*
- We want to see Jesus in the songs and poetry of the Hebrew Scriptures.
- In a few of the Minor Prophets, the presence of the Lord may not have been easy to discover. In some passages where His coming was clearly foretold, we recognized *Jesus* as *the Hope of Israel, the Offspring of the woman and the Lamb* the Lord would provide.
- We need to always keep in mind that, as *“the Word,”* Jesus is present in all of Scripture. Jesus is *“the Word”* of God.
- As Peter said of the prophets, *“the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing”* to *“the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.”* **1 Peter 1:11**
- In all of Scripture, Jesus is present on every page. He is our Poet.

**The Book of Psalms in** *“The Writings”*

- Not always listed first in this last portion of the Tanakh. In some ancient collections Chronicles was listed first and in others, Ruth.
- These five books in *“The Writings”*: *Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon*, are often called the books of poetry.
- The third division of the Hebrew Scriptures included these books along with *Ruth, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles*.
- The Psalms are the largest part of this group and this may be the reason the entire section is sometimes called by that name.
- In the Septuagint (LXX) arrangement of the Bible, when the New Testament is added, Psalms is in the center of the Scriptures.
- Did God place a hymnal in the middle of the Bible because He wanted His people to sing?

**Fascinating Facts about the Songs of the Jews – Psalms**

- The Psalms are beautiful expressions of praise and prayer.
- Many Psalms have an inscription containing historical information or what may be musical notation.
- Although these inscriptions are usually not considered to be *“God-breathed,”* (**2 Timothy 3:16**), they are accepted as ancient, accurate and helpful for understanding the context of the Psalm.
- The word *“Psalms”* comes from a word referring to the playing of a stringed instrument.
- An early Hebrew name for the first group of these collected poems was *“tephilloth,”* Hebrew for *“prayers.”*

**The Arrangement of the Psalms**

- The 150 Psalms are arranged in five distinct books:
- Book 1—Psalms 1-41
    - David considered to be the author, though some do not bear his name.
- Book 2—Psalms 42-72
    - Psalms 42-49 are ascribed to the *“Sons of Korah.”*
    - Psalm 50 is a Psalm of Asaph.
    - Psalms 51-71 are considered to be *“Of David.”*
    - Psalm 72’s inscription, *“Of Solomon,”* may mean either it is about Solomon or may mean that Solomon was the author.
- Book 3—Psalms 73-89
    - Psalms 73-83 were written by Asaph.
    - Psalms 84, 85, 87, and 88 (“of Heman”) were by “the Sons of Korah.”
    - Psalm 86 was written by David.
    - Psalm 89 was written by Ethan the Ezrahite.
- Book 4—Psalms 90-106
    - Only Moses and David are the authors.
    - Psalm 90 is *“A prayer of Moses.”*
    - Psalms 101 and 103 were written by David.
    - Portions of Psalms 96, 105 and 106 are found in David’s psalm of thanks in **1 Chronicles 16** and likely authored by David as are most of the rest of the Psalms in Book 4.
- Book 5—Psalms 107-150
    - Psalm 127 is said to be *“Of Solomon.”*
    - Twelve of these are attributed to David and many of the rest are considered to have been written by him as well.

**About the Authors**

- David, *“Israel’s singer of songs,”* (**2 Samuel 23:1**), is clearly the author of the majority of the Psalms.
- Study of David’s life is helped when we read his thoughts and prayers poured out in poetry.
- Little is known of Asaph, but he was one of David’s appointed musicians. (**1 Chronicles 16:5**) In **2 Chronicles 29:30** he is called *“Asaph the seer.”*
- The *“Sons of Korah”* is a fascinating study.
    - They were Levites descended from Korah who perished in the rebellion against Moses.
    - **Numbers 26:11** says, *“The line of Korah, however, did not die out.”*

**Inscriptions**

- Interesting Hebrew words that are difficult to define: sheminith, shiggaion and miktam are thought to be musical notations or directions to singers.
- *“With stringed instruments,”* (**Psalm 4**) and *“for flutes,”* (**Psalm 5**) gives us hints about Hebrew music.
- We also find *“tunes”* such as, *“To [the tune of] The Death of the Son,”* (**Psalm 9**), *“The Doe of the Morning,”* (**Psalm 22**), or *“Lilies,”* (**Psalm 45**).
- Some *“tunes”* are used for different *“lyrics.”* Psalms 57-59 are set to the tune *“Do Not Destroy.”*
- Instructor’s note – *“As a musician, I have been intrigued by these unknown melodies. I have always considered lyrics as more important than melody and wondered if the LORD kept the tunes from us so we could invent our own.”*

**Musical Instruments**

- It is fascinating that musical instruments are mentioned.
- **Psalm 81:2** says, *“Begin the music, strike the tambourine, play the melodious harp and lyre.”*
- Exact identification of these is difficult. Ancient drawing and actual artifacts tell us what they may have looked like.
- **Psalm 150** mentions trumpets, harps, flutes and two types of cymbals.

**Meters**

- See the *Bibliology and How to Study the Bible* course for more information on the way Hebrew poetry is written.
- English poetry uses various rhythmic *“meters”* and often similar sounding words for rhyming.
- Hebrew also has a sense of rhythm which would be impossible to translate into another language.
- What Hebrew poetry does is rhyme thoughts or expressions which are possible to translate into other languages.

**Three Primary Ways to Rhyme** *“Thoughts”* or *“Expressions”*

- Synonymous
    - Make a statement and then *“rhyme”* or restate the original thought in different words.
    - Example: Psalm 24 begins, *“The earth is the LORD’s and everything in it, the world and all who live in it.”*
- Antithetic
    - An original statement is clarified by an opposite expression.
    - Example: **Psalm 1:6**, *“For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.”*
- These first two forms exist in couplets.
- Synthetic
    - Composed of more than two lines.
    - After an original statement, one or more lines follow and simply add more information.
    - Example: **Psalm 1:3**, *“He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yield its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.”*

*“Acrostic”* **Psalms**

- Each new verse begins with the 22 consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
- Psalms 9, 10, 25, 34 and 145 are acrostic poems which have omitted or duplicated some letters.
- Psalms 37, 111 and 112 are complete acrostic poems.
- Psalm 119 is the ultimate acrostic poem.
- It has 22 *“strophes”* (a connected series of verses), one for each Hebrew letter.
- Each strophe has 8 verses and each verse begins with the same letter.
- Psalm 119 is a hymn (or 22 hymns) praising the Word of God. At least seven synonyms for God’s Word are used in this Psalm. **Of the 176 verses, only five do not use one of the terms. See if you can find them**.

**“Chiastic” Psalms**

- Another form of Hebrew poetry that is harder to detect.
- Named for the Greek letter X (chi), pronounced *“key.”*
- Couplets are grouped in a specific order with later couplets mirroring earlier ones. One example may be Psalm 1.
- Jesus, the Poet, probably had this form in mind in the Beatitudes at the beginning of His sermon in Matthew 5.
    - Notice: The first couplet (Matthew 5:3) and the last (Matthew 5:10) begin with different statements but end with the same promise.
    - Verse 10, mirrors verse 3; verse 9, mirrors verse 4; etc.
    - This form helps us grasp a deeper sense of Jesus’ meaning and a greater appreciation for his skill with words.

**Psalm Groupings**

- Psalms are often placed in significant relationship to each other.
- Psalm 4 is an *“evening song”* (note v. 8), whereas Psalm 5 is a *“morning song”* (**Psalm 5:3**).
- Psalm 22 reveals Jesus suffering, Psalm 23 reveals Jesus as Shepherd and Psalm 24 reveals Jesus as King.
- Fifteen Psalms from 120-134 are labeled *“A Song of Ascents”* or *“A Song of Degrees.”* These may have been sung by pilgrims approaching Jerusalem or that they corresponded to the fifteen steps up to the Temple.

**Psalms as Prayers**

- Offer intimate glimpses into the writer’s deepest longings.
- They are God-inspired prayers that invite us into the same longings.
- Prayers of psalmists offer insight into Jesus’ longings and sufferings.
- Psalm 22 which begins, *“My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?”* are Jesus words uttered from the cross. **Matthew 27:46**
- Psalm 22:31b, *“He has done it,”* is a strong resemblance to Jesus’ cry of *“it is finished!”* (**John 19:30**), and suggests that Jesus quoted this entire Psalm from the cross.

**Review**

- We looked at the Psalms as a whole and noted their place in the Scriptures as a *“hymn book”* in the middle of the Bible.
- We learned the inscriptions at the beginning of many Psalms are worth noting and can be helpful.
- We reviewed the five books within the book of Psalms and learned a little about the various authors in those collections.
- We discussed information about tunes and instruments used for accompaniment and studied the basic forms of Hebrew poetry: three ways of *“rhyming”* thoughts and the forms of Acrostic and Chiastic poems.
- We saw examples of how some Psalms are placed in relation to others in meaningful groups.
- We were reminded of the deeply personal nature of many of the Psalms.
- We recognized Jesus, the Poet, who reveals Himself in these beautiful expressions and invites us to know his heart

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will take special note of the Messianic Psalms which point unmistakably to Jesus.
- We will highlight Psalms quoted directly by the Lord as referring to Himself, or as prophetic to his life and ministry.
- We will study the two types of Messianic Psalms: those that point to the suffering of the Messiah and those that look forward to his coming kingdom.

## Class Exercise

Be prepared to discuss the KNOW, ARE ABLE TO and WILL BE THINKING ABOUT statements from this session that appear at the beginning of this session in your guidebook.

Answer these questions about the Line of Korah:

1. With your Bibles and any other research materials, look at the line of Korah.  

    > The story of Korah’s rebellion is told in Numbers 16-17. His genealogy as a descendant of Levi is found in Exodus 6:16-25 and again in **1 Chronicles 6:22, 37**. The **1 Chronicles** passage is a list of *“The Temple musicians.”*

2. Who were his ancestors?  

    > **Exodus 6:16-21**

3. Who were his sons?  

    > **Exodus 6:24**

4. How many Psalms are accredited to the sons of Korah?  

    > 11 or 13 — two Psalms are not directly accredited to the sons of Korah.

5. List them.  

    > Psalm 42, (43?), 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 84, 85, 87, 88, (89?)

6. Do you think that the sons of Korah thought about their ancestors as they wrote their psalms? Discuss this in class.

    **Answer provided by AI**

    Yes, it is likely that the sons of Korah thought about their ancestors as they wrote their psalms. Their family name reminded them that God judged rebellion but also showed great mercy by preserving their line (**Numbers 26:11**). As Temple musicians, this history may have shaped their deep longing for God, their emphasis on trust, and their gratitude for being allowed to worship Him.

    1. Do you think *“The Sons of Korah”* was just a title given to a group of musicians like *“The Beatles”* or the *“Red Hot Chilli Peppers”?* or were they actual descendants of Korah of whom it is said, though he died for his rebellion, *“the line of Korah did not die out.”* **Numbers 26:11*
    2. What connotation does the name *“The Sons of Korah”* carry with it for the Temple musicians of King David’s day?
    3. Do you think it would be a reminder of God’s grace in sparing sinners from judgment? Or do you think that by being known by that name would be a reminder of and a warning against rebellion?

7. Choose a favorite Psalm and identify the different forms of Hebrew poetry it contains. Be prepared to share your findings with your class or moderator.  

    > Open to personal preference.

8. In Psalm 119, find the synonyms for God’s Word and find the five verses that do not use any of them.  

    > **Synonym of God's Word:**  
    > *Law(s), Statutes, Ways, Precepts, Decrees, Command(s), Word, Promise(s)*.  
    >
    > Five verses that do not use one of these synonyms: 84, 90, 121, 122, 132.
