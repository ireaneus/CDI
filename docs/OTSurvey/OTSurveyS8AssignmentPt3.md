**Begin video.**

**Review of the Previous Session**

- Solomon became King after his father, David.
- The LORD chose him to be King of Israel.
- Solomon completed the glorious Temple that would be the heart of the nation.
- He was the expected fulfillment of God’s promise to David of a son whose reign would never end.
- He began in God-given wisdom and righteousness, but ended a disappointment.
- Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, would not be a man of wisdom.

**Preview of the Divided Kingdom**

- From the death of Solomon to the Babylonian captivity is a period of just over 300 years.
- Solomon’s unfaithfulness in his later years resulted in civil war and a divided nation.
- In the first years of his reign, his son, Rehoboam, failed to understand the needs of his people and the 10 northern tribes of Israel rebelled.
- Under the leadership of Jeroboam and the tribe of Ephraim, these tribes would be known as the nation of Israel.
- The city of Shechem became the first capital of Israel.
- The tribe of Benjamin stayed rooted in the south and identified with the tribe of Judah with Jerusalem as the capital. This would be known as the kingdom of Judah and is likely the origination of the name *“Jew”* for: *“from the tribe of Judah.”*
- The history recorded in the books of Kings looks at all the kings of both Judah and Israel, but special attention is given to Israel.
- The *“cross-over”* as the kingdoms of Judah and Israel interact is absent in the Chronicles. 2 Chronicles, written after the exiles of Judah returned from captivity, is only concerned with the history of the southern kingdom and the kings descended from David.
- We will look at the ministries of the two great prophets Elijah and Elisha, who spoke the word of the LORD to Israel. It is mainly by following the stories of Elijah and Elisha that we are given much insight into the reigns of the kings of Israel.

**The Break-Up of the Nation of Israel**

- Foretold in 1 Kings 11 where Jeroboam, one of Solomon’s officials, is singled out for his leadership abilities.
- Solomon’s unfaithfulness results in the prophet Ahijah declaring that Jeroboam will be given 10 of the tribes of Israel. **1 Kings 11:34-37**
- Rehoboam is too weak and immature to listen to wise advice the northern ten tribes rebel.
- David’s descendants continue to reign on David’s throne, but the northern Kingdom of Israel will be ruled by eighteen kings – none of which will walk in obedience to the LORD.

**Jeroboam, the First King of the Newly Formed Kingdom of Israel**

- Makes a practical, but terrible decision.
- Knowing that the 10 tribes will still feel drawn to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem, he sets up idols in Bethel and Dan.
- He tells the people, *“It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”* **1 Kings 12:28**
- All but 3 of Israel’s 20 kings *“did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam.”* **2 Kings 13:6**

**The Kings of Judah**

- 19 kings and 1 queen reigned in Jerusalem, in David’s line, from the reign of Rehoboam to the Babylonian captivity.
- Eight were said to have done what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as their father David had done.
- Final 11 chapters of 1 Kings covers briefly the reigns of Abijah, Asa and Jehoshaphat.

**Early Kings of Israel**

- In 1 Kings 16, Omri becomes the 6th King of Israel.
- He establishes the city of Samaria as the capital and it remains until the Assyrians destroy it in 722 BC.

**Ahab and Elijah**

- Most of the second half of 1 Kings describes the reign of Ahab and his wicked wife, Jezebel, and the ministry of the prophet Elijah.
- Ahab *“did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those before him.”* **1 Kings 16:30**
- Because of Ahab’s unfaithfulness, Elijah prays that the LORD will withhold rain from Israel.
- At the end of three and a half years without rain, Elijah confronts the prophets of Baal – one of the most powerful stories in the Old Testament.
- Jezebel’s prophets of Baal cry out all day and even mutilate themselves, pleading to their false and powerless idol – all to no avail.
- Elijah offers earnest prayer (1 Kings 18:36-37) and fire falls from heaven in a demonstration of the mighty power of the true God.
- The people exclaim, *“The LORD – He is God! The LORD – He is God!”* and the false prophets are destroyed, but Jezebel wants to kill Elijah. **1 Kings 18:39**
- 1 Kings 19 relates Elijah’s exhausted plea for God to take his life, but the LORD wonderfully reminds him, *“Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel – all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal.”* **1 Kings 19:18**
- Elijah is commissioned to anoint his replacement, Elisha, as well as new leadership for Aram and Israel.
- 1 Kings ends with Ahab’s death as foretold by the prophet Micaiah.
- The Chronicles omit this but give details of the faith and leadership of Jehoshaphat, the third king after Rehoboam, in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 19-20

**2 Kings – Prophets**

- Begins with the transfer of the mantel of the prophet Elijah to Elisha. Elisha’s ministry is the focus of the first 8 chapters of 2 Kings.
- At Elijah’s departure, Elisha asks for and receives a *“double portion”* of his master’s spirit. **2 Kings 2:9**
- Because he watches as Elijah is taken up into Heaven in a whirlwind, he picks up his master’s cloak and the miracles he performs double those of Elijah.
- Several other prophets appear at key points in the histories of Judah and Israel.
- Moses had said that *“the LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers, you must listen to him.”* **Deut. 18:15**
- Just as the anointed kings were the hope of God’s people for a perfect ruler, so the prophets stood in the line of hope for the Prophet who would come.
- Prophets were God’s spokesmen who brought the Word of the LORD.
- Some portrayed Jesus clearly, others dimly.
- Concerning salvation, Peter says that, *“The prophets who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, trying to find out the time and circumstance to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing.”* **1 Peter 1:10-11**
- Hebrew prophets foreshadowed our Great Prophet, the Lord Jesus, the Anointed, who is the Word of the LORD.

**2 Kings 9 and 10**

- Jehu anointed king over Israel and told to bring judgment on the wicked house of Ahab and the servants of Baal.
- He carries out this mission including the murder of Judah’s king, Ahaziah. This assassination ushers in the brutal reign of Queen Athaliah.
- Her reign ends when the faithful priest, Jehoiada, rescues the infant King Joash. At age 7, Joash, with the help of Jehoiada, begins to reign.
- His reign begins well but ends badly. This much-repeated theme continues to demonstrate that the promised Son of David must be more than a mere man.
- Kings of Judah who walk in the faith of David are imperfect glimpses of who the true Messiah will be.
- The unfaithful kings are antithetic types, negative images, defining by their actions what He, when he comes, will certainly not be.

**Timeline**

- Easy to become confused by going back and forth between the kings of Judah and the kings of Israel.
- Many of their names are unfamiliar but similar.
- Also, some of the kings go by two different names – *Azariah, king of Judah*, is called *Uzziah* in 2 Chronicles. (See **2 Kings 15 and 2 Chronicles 26**)
- Purchasing a Biblical timeline would make it easy to place all these kings in proper order, but placing them on your own Timeline will be much more meaningful and memorable and enable you to clearly place the events and teachings of Scripture in proper context. When you study Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, this will be even more relevant.

**The Final Kings of Israel**

- 2 Kings 15, lists a rapid succession of eight kings of Israel as that nation lurches toward destruction.
- Following the reign of Jeroboam II, in a period of only 57 years and 7 months, Israel is ruled by its final six kings.
- Three of those kings ascend to the throne by assassinating their predecessors.
- During the reigns of Ahaz and Hezekiah in Jerusalem, the Northern Kingdom of Israel is over-run by the Assyrians.
- The remnants of the ten tribes that rebelled against Rehoboam are deported and resettled in foreign lands and are no more.
- *“This happened because they had not obeyed the LORD their God, but had violated his covenant – all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out.”* **2 Kings 18:12; 2 Kings 17:7-23**

**The Final Kings of Judah**

- The parallel accounts are covered in the final 10 chapters of 2 Kings and the final 9 chapters of 2 Chronicles.
- Dramatic swings from wicked King Ahaz, to his faithful son Hezekiah, to the evil Manasseh, to his humble, faithful grandson, Josiah stand out in these closing chapters.
- Ahaz schemes and draws the Assyrians to help destroy Israel, but the king of Assyria gives him *“trouble instead of help.”* **2 Chronicles 28:20**
- Ahaz corrupts the priesthood and plunges the nation further into idolatry.
- Hezekiah, Ahaz’s son, and the prophet Isaiah will call the nation back to the LORD as the Assyrian army surrounds Jerusalem.
- Manasseh, Hezekiah’s son does, *“much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.”* **2 Kings 21:6**
- Manasseh’s repentance is told in 2 Chronicles, but omitted in the 2 Kings account.
- Manasseh’s grandson, Josiah, is the last good king in Jerusalem until *“he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his.”* **Genesis 49:10**
- More study of the final years of Judah will be included in the study of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel where great prophetic writings give much historical insight into the final years of Jerusalem.

**Review**

- 350 years of the divided kingdom.
- In the northern kingdom of Israel, all the kings held on to the fatal sin of their first king, Jeroboam: the false idols of Bethel and Dan.
- After 350 years, the Northern Kingdom of Israel is completely destroyed.
- We few kings of the Southern Kingdom of Judah would walk in the faith of David. The wild swings back and forth from good kings to evil ones would bring Judah to judgment.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- In the ministries and messages of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in the midst of their calls for repentance, there were mighty revelations.
- They speak of a Son who will be born, a Prince of Peace, a coming King and Prophet, of a New Covenant and of a New Heaven and New Earth.
