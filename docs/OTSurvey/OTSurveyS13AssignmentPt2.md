**Review of Previous Session**

- We surveyed the books of Ezra and Nehemiah with a short glimpse of Esther.
- Ezra a historian and teacher was dedicated to seeing the Jews who had returned from the Babylonian captivity grounded in their history.
- Ezra was zealous to prepare a people ready for their Messiah.
- Nehemiah was also concerned about the exiles in Jerusalem.
- He heard of the broken walls of the city. He prayed and went to help the exiles rebuild the walls.
- Nehemiah was single-minded in his devotion to the work and developed strategies for dealing with those trying to hinder the work, both outside and inside the walls.
- There is much to learn from these men about Jesus, the Teacher, and the Builder of his Church.

**Background on Daniel**

- Daniel appears in the third section of the Tanakh, *“The Writings,”* not in *“The Prophets,”* but he is one of the greatest OT Prophets.
- Much of the book of Daniel is historical narrative and not prophetic which may have led to its inclusion in *“The Writings.”*
- Daniel was a youth among the first captives Nebuchadnezzar took from Jerusalem along with King Jehoiakim in **605 BC**.
- He may have been part of the royal family or of the *“nobility.”* **Daniel 1:3**
- He remained in Babylon throughout the 70 year-capitivity, likely dying there.
- With similarities to Joseph in Egypt, he trusted and sought to please God and was exalted to high honor in both Babylon and Persia.

**Background on the Book of Daniel**

- The book of Daniel has two clear divisions.
- Daniel 1-6 is the history of Daniel’s rise from captive to the adviser of kings.
- Each chapter is a separate story of the faithfulness and courage of *Daniel and his three fellow captives, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah*.
- Daniel 7-12 is the account of four extraordinary visions given Daniel by God.
- Daniel was given a prophetic picture of the future nations of Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome.
- The accurate details of future events revealed in these visions has led unbelieving scholars to deny Daniel as the author and say that it was written after the events occurred. The theories of these false teachers have been completely refuted.

**Chapter 1 – The First Story**

- Daniel told how he and his friends *“resolved not to defile”* themselves with the royal food and wine given to them when they arrived in Babylon. **Daniel 1:8**
- Their faithfulness to the LORD’s commands, rather than those of the king, led to their first promotion into the king’s favor.

**Chapter 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream**

- The king wakes from a troubling dream, that he can’t remember. He asks the impossible of his own astrologers: *“tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”* **Daniel 2:6**
- Frustrated at his advisors stalling, the king orders all the wise men to be executed.
- Daniel asks for time to interpret the dream and he and his friends ask God for a miracle.
- The LORD answered their prayers and the king’s dream and its interpretation are given to Daniel.
- The dream is of a statue of a man made of various metals – this has implications down to the second coming of Jesus and his eternal kingdom.
- King Nebuchadnezzar honors Daniel and Daniel’s God, whom he calls *“the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries.”* **Daniel 2:47**
- The revelations of this dream will be seen in a different form in Daniel’s vision recorded in chapter 7.

**Chapter 3 – The Blazing Furnace**

- This is the king’s mistaken response to his dream.
- He chooses to exalt himself by building a statue of gold and commanding all in his kingdom to bow to it.
- Daniel is not mentioned here, but his three friends refuse to bow.
- The punishment for refusal was to be thrown into a blazing furnace.
- *Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah* refused to worship the image with this wonderful statement of faith:
    - *“King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty’s hand. But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”* **Daniel 3:16-18**
- Their God does deliver them and he joins them in the midst of the fire.
- At the king’s command they come out of the furnace with no sign or odor of fire. The king announces, *“No other god can save in this way.”* **Daniel 3:29**

**Chapter 4 – Dream of a Tree**

- Nebuchadnezzar has another dream that his wise men cannot, or dare not, interpret.
- The growing friendship between this Gentile king and his Jewish adviser shows when Daniel is saddened by the clear meaning of the dream.
- Nebuchadnezzar will suffer a strange illness, to humble him, and then be restored to his throne.
- The illness happened and the king concluded in humility, *“Now I praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything He does is right and all His ways are just. And those who walk in pride He is able to humble.”* **Daniel 4:37**
- This chapter gives an important clue about God’s timing – the king was humbled for *“seven times,”* most likely meaning seven years. This will be important to remember in Daniel’s vision in chapter 9.

**Daniel 5 – The End of Babylon**

- Nebuchadnezzar’s son, Belshazzar did not learn humility from his father.
- His profane use of the golden cups taken from the Temple in Jerusalem brings his life and the kingdom to an end.
- The city of Babylon was considered unconquerable. Its brick walls were said to be 56 miles long, 300 feet high and 25 feet thick, with another wall 75 feet behind the first wall. The wall extended 35 feet below ground.
- The Persians, commanded by Cyrus, diverted the river which ran through the city, then entered and conquered Babylon.
- On the very night of Daniel’s courageous interpretation of the mysterious message in Daniel 5, the kingdom of the Medes and Persians came to power.

**Chapter 6 – The Lion’s Den**

- This is the famous story of Daniel’s faithfulness to God in spite of the threat of being thrown into the lion’s den.
- Daniel’s favor with both Cyrus the Persian and Darius the Mede may have contributed to the return of the exiles to Jerusalem.

**Chapter 7 – Daniel’s First Vision**

- This is the first of the four visions. Daniel is shown God’s view of the four nations that Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream in Daniel 2.
- The vision of 4 beasts in Daniel 7 correspond directly to the 4 metals of the image in King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.
- The metals of the image decreased in value, but grew in hardness from top to bottom; each beast in Daniel’s vision is stronger and more vicious.
- In both cases the coming of the kingdom of God is irresistible.

**Chapter 8 – Daniel’s Second Vision**

- This vision concerns the transition between the second and third beasts of his first vision.
- It accurately depicts Alexander the Great’s conquest of Persia in *331 BC*.
- The division of the lands he conquered to his four generals is also foreseen.

**Chapter 9 – Daniel’s Third Vision**

- This is one of the most fascinating prophecies in Scripture.
- This third vision comes in answer to Daniel’s prayer for understanding of *Jeremiah’s* prophecy that the exile would last 70 years. **Jeremiah 25:11**
- The 70 years were completed and Daniel asked the LORD for full meaning.
- The angel Gabriel is sent to give *“insight and understanding”* (**Daniel 9:22**), to this faithful servant who is *“highly esteemed.”* **Daniel 9:23**
- The explanation of Jeremiah’s prophecy is given in two parts. **Daniel 9:24-27**
- Gabriel’s explanation is in 2 parts:
    - First, **Daniel 9:24** gives a glimpse of the completion of God’s plans for His people and for Jerusalem. *“Seventy ‘sevens’ are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.”*
    - The fulfillment of God’s purposes for these words points to the Righteous Kingdom guaranteed by Jesus’ death and resurrection.
    - Second, the *“seventy ‘sevens,’”* are explained to mean 70 *“weeks”* of 7 years or a total of 490 years *“to bring in everlasting righteousness.”*
    - The 490 years are divided into two periods: The first 69 ‘sevens’ (the “seven ‘sevens’ and 62 ‘sevens’” of **Daniel 9:25**) and a final “seven.” **Daniel 9:26–27**
    - At the beginning of or within the last ‘seven’ the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing.” **Daniel 9:26**
- Gabriel’s explanation has been debated for thousands of years.
- What is most helpful here is that by many calculations, Jesus arrived in Jerusalem at exactly the right time.
- The King who came *“to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness”* gave his life and conquered the grave! **Daniel 9:24**
- His kingdom WILL come!

**Chapters 10 – 12 – Daniel’s Fourth Vision**

- Describes also another angelic explanation.
- The details given perfectly foretold events before Jesus’ first coming, and provided glimpses of a distant future that even Daniel was not allowed to understand.
- The angel’s final words to Daniel: *“Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand… As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”* **Daniel 12:9–10, 13**

**Daniel – A Great Prophet of the Old Testament**

- Daniel occupies a place of highest honor among the great prophets.
- He was a man of integrity from his youth and God favored him with great responsibility.
- He was allowed to see the near future of his people’s struggles leading to the coming of the Anointed One, Jesus.
- He also saw far ahead to the establishment of the eternal kingdom of the Messiah whose *“dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.”* **Daniel 7:14**

**Review**

- We have now completed a survey of the entire Hebrew Scriptures.
- We covered all 24 books of the Tanakh, though a few have received only slight mention.

*Note from Pastor Cliff Horr:* *“I have personally appreciated the privilege of this study. It would be impossible to survey these inspired Scriptures in this limited format without leaving out many important things. You have a framework from which to continue your own life-long study of the holy Scriptures. These are the Scriptures that speak of Jesus on every page: ‘He is the true God and eternal life.’”* **1 John 5:20**
*Jesus said of the Old Testament, the Hebrew Scriptures:*  
*“You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about Me.”* **John 5:39**
