**Begin video.**

**In the Last Session**

- We saw the three 40 year divisions of Moses’ life:
    - Forty years as a prince of Egypt
    - Forty years as an unknown shepherd in the desert of Midian
    - Forty years that began when God called him to go back to Egypt to free the Israelites from slavery.
- The first 80 years of Moses’ life received very little attention in Scripture, yet even there we saw how he foreshadowed Christ who would come to bring an even
greater freedom.
- At approximately 80 years of age, Moses was commissioned by God to lead His people to freedom.
- The Israelites had left Egypt, walked through the Red Sea by the miraculous power of God and, after a few quarrelsome weeks, arrived at Mt. Sinai.
- When God had appeared to Moses in the burning bush, it was on this very mountain, and He had told Moses, *“When you have brought the people out of Egypt you will worship God on this mountain.”* **Exodus 3:12**

**On the Way from the Sea to the Mountain**

- Several important events that set the tone for much of the rest of the history of the Hebrew people.
- First, they grumbled about lack of water and God miraculously turned bitter waters sweet at Marah. Exodus 15
- Next, they complained at the lack of food and God miraculously provided manna and quail.
- Jesus later spoke of the manna as a foreshadowing of Himself. He said, *“I am the bread of Life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.”* **John 6:48-51**
- A second time they complained of a lack of water and God instructed Moses to *“strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.”* **Exodus 17:6**
- The Apostle Paul said, in **1 Corinthians 10:4**, *“they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.”* (Remember Jesus’ words in **John 5:39**, *“these are the Scriptures that testify about Me.”*)

**Momentous Events at Mt. Sinai**

- The Israelites spent their first year of freedom at Mt. Sinai. **Exodus 40:17** A period covered from **Exodus 19 through Numbers 10:10**.
- At the beginning of this time, God spoke to His people from the mountain and gave them the Ten Commandments.
- He also gave them the entire system of sacrifices outlined in Exodus and Leviticus to provide atonement for them when they transgressed the Law.
- They also received a large body of civil codes dealing with a variety of issues and a list of annual feasts they were to celebrate.
- These feasts, each in their own way, picture and point to Jesus.
- The Ten Commandments have long been the focus of the Law, but there was much more involved.

**Specific Events at Mt. Sinai**

- Some events are often misrepresented, for example:
    - How many times did Moses ascend and descend the mountain?
    - Where was Moses when God spoke His commandments to the people?
- God was speaking to all the people gathered before the mountain, but in fear, they said to Moses, *“Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.”* **Exodus 20:19**
- Moses recounted these events in **Deuteronomy 5:22-29**.
- Following this dramatic scene, the LORD instructed Moses to *“Make an altar of earth for Me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.”* **Exodus 20:24**
- In **Romans 8:3**, Paul pointed out, *“what the Law was powerless to do, in that  it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of flesh to be a sin offering.”*
- The Law reveals God’s righteousness but it cannot enable the flesh. *“The Law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good”* **(Romans 7:12)**, but *“In order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.”* **Romans 7:13b**

**New Testament Discussion Concerning Law and Grace**

- These moral, religious and civil codes given through Moses are contrasted with grace.
- The value of these Laws is not canceled by grace, but they were never a means of salvation.
- In Romans 7, Paul pointed out that the true value of the Law is to clarify and
magnify sin and point us to our need for Jesus.
- In another sense, Jesus, who was *“without sin”*, perfectly embodies the Law. He is *“the Righteous One.”* **(cf. Isaiah 24:16; Acts 3:14; 7:52; 22:14)**

**The Mosaic Covenant**

- The Mosaic covenant is the agreement that the LORD makes with the Israelites at Mt. Sinai.
- When Moses first returns to the mountain, the LORD tells him that if the people agree *“to obey Me fully and keep My covenant”*, then out of all nations they will be His treasured possession. **Exodus 19:5**
- Moses went back down the mountain and presented this offer to the leaders. *“The people all responded together, ‘We will do everything the LORD has said.’ So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.”* **Exodus 19:8**
- This covenant is later confirmed in **Exodus 24:1-8**, by the people’s pledge to keep all the requirements of God’s law and by the blood of a sacrifice. *“Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, ‘This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.’”* **Exodus 24:8**

**The Tabernacle**

- Another important aspect of the Law was the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings and the institution of the Priesthood.
- The instructions begin in Exodus 25.
- The furnishings are the Ark and the atonement cover, the table for the *“bread of the Presence”* and the Lampstand.
- In the Ark was to be placed the *“Testimony”* and, originally, a jar of manna.
- The LORD tells Moses: *“Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.”* **Exodus 25:9** The word *“pattern,”* is what the writer of Hebrews translates into Greek as *“type”* as in **Hebrews 8:5**.
- Next God gave Moses instructions concerning the materials and construction of the tabernacle itself, the building of an altar for burnt offerings and a protected courtyard around the tabernacle.

**The Tabernacle Speaks of Jesus**

- In every detail the material of the tabernacle speaks of Jesus. The blue, purple
and scarlet finely twisted yarn symbolizes Deity, royalty and sacrifice.
- The various animal hides covering the sanctuary speak of the One to come who would dwell among us.
- The curtain separating the two inner compartments is of particular interest.
- In the outer room or *“Holy Place”* were the table for the bread of the Presence, the Lamp and the altar of incense.
- In this place the priests were to enter daily to perform their duties.
- The inner room, the *“Holy of Holies”* contained the Ark of the Covenant with the Atonement Cover. Only the High Priest could enter this room, and only on one day of the year: the Day of Atonement.
- The curtain between the two rooms is that which was *“torn in two from top to
bottom”* **(Matthew 27:51)**, as Jesus died on the cross.
- The writer of Hebrews tells us that now *“we have confidence to enter the Most
Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through
the curtain, that is, His body.”* **Hebrews 10:19-20**
- Finally, there are instructions for the priestly garments – first for the High Priest and then for the others.
- Hebrews 9 begins a discussion of the meaning behind all that is associated with the tabernacle.
- Every article made *“like the pattern”* shown to Moses carries deep significance and points directly to Jesus.
- Tracing the items of the tabernacle and the tent through the Scriptures, we find they profoundly speak of Jesus - our *“atoning sacrifice”* **(1 John 2:2)**, *“the living bread”* **(John 6:51)**, *“the light of the world”* **(John 9:5)**, and our *“great High Priest”* **(Hebrews 4:14)** who *“became flesh and dwelt [tabernacled] among us”* **(John 1:14).**

**Additional Items to be Made for the Tabernacle**

- After the initial instructions for furnishings of the tabernacle and the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests, Exodus 29 gave additional items to be made.
- The altar of incense to go inside the Holy Place *“in front of the curtain that is before the Ark of the Testimony”* **Exodus 30:6**
- A special basin for washing that stood between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar for burnt offerings **Exodus 30:17-21**

**The Sad Account of the Golden Calf**

- We read about this in Exodus 32 through 34, and one important outcome of this event is the singling out of the tribe of Levi as priests. **Exodus 32:25-29**
- Moses and his brother Aaron were from the tribe of Levi and the priesthood was initially given to Aaron and his sons. Because of the loyalty of the tribe of Levi to Moses at this time, the entire tribe was set apart for the service of the tabernacle.
- Because of this, they were not to be given the normal inheritance along with the other tribes, but rather were to be supplied primarily through the offerings presented to the LORD.
- After the affair of the golden calf, Moses and the LORD have a conversation recorded in Exodus 33. The LORD warned Moses that on the coming journey to the Promised Land, *“I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”* **Exodus 33:3**
- Moses and all the people mourned this distressing announcement and Moses said to the LORD, *“If Your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. How will anyone know that You are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?” And the LORD said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”* **Exodus 33:15-17**

**Moses’ Unique Encounter with God**

- In this encounter Moses said, *“Now show me your glory.”* The LORD causes His goodness to pass in front of him but states, *“But, you cannot see My face, for no one may see Me and live.”* **Exodus 33:20**
- The LORD then places Moses in a *“cleft in the rock”* and covers him with his hand. As he passes by he announces, *“The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.”* **Exodus 34:6**
- At this time, God instructed Moses to chisel out two stone tablets to replace the ones that were broken when Moses first saw the golden calf, and Moses writes on them *“the Covenant, the Ten Commandments.”* **Exodus 34:28**

**The Final Chapters of Exodus**

- The last section of Exodus deals with the people’s offerings of the needed materials for building the tabernacle, the construction of the various items, the initial set up and the description of God’s glory descending upon it.
- All these things not only speak of and point to Jesus, but it is the actual presence of the *“Word who became flesh”* **(John 1:14)** who meets with Moses and directs the process that will provide this place where God will dwell among His people.

**Review**

- Jesus is revealed in the giving of the Law and the building of the tabernacle.
- In the account of the Exodus, is the greatest Old Testament picture of redemption
and deliverance from bondage.
- We have, in the provision of the Law, that which not only reveals the righteousness of God but, in God’s grace, was given to lead us to Christ. **Galatians 3:24**
- In the tabernacle, we have the construction of a place for God’s people to meet
with Him that in every detail speaks of a Person who would come.
- These are most powerfully “the Scriptures that testify” about Jesus.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We’ll look at the remaining three books of the Pentateuch: Leviticus, Numbers and
Deuteronomy.
- Leviticus deals with the duties of the tribe of Levi in regard to the sacrifices and feasts and additional civil regulations.
- Numbers spans the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness because of the people’s failure to trust the LORD when they first came to the Promised Land.
- Deuteronomy contains a second listing of the Ten Commandments and Moses’s final words of encouragement and warning to his people before his death.
