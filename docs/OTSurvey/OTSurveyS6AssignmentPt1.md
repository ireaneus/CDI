unique circumstances of his birth.
- Moses flees from Pharaoh at age 40 and spends 40 years as a shepherd.

**Begin video.**

**Review**

- The Books of Moses are also known as the *“Pentateuch”* (Five Volumes); and collectively, *“The Law.”*
- This is the first section of both the Septuagint and the Tanakh.
- Moses, the human author, does not enter the narrative until 300 years after the last verses of Genesis.

**The Conclusion of Genesis**

- The children of Israel were in Egypt under the protection and provision of Joseph, Jacob's eleventh son.
- Joseph, by God’s grace, had become *“father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.”* **Genesis 45:8**
- Genesis ends with Joseph’s somber words: *“Then Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’ And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, ‘God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.’ So Joseph died at the age of 110 years old. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.”* **Genesis 50:24-26**

**Exodus Begins**

- Exodus 1 paints a very different picture of the conditions of the sons of Israel  in Egypt.
- The scene in the opening chapter sets the stage for the greatest Old Testament
story of redemption.
- The small clans of the 70 descendants of Jacob who entered Egypt had become a great people. *“The Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.”* **(Exodus 1:7)** This is the good news.
- The bad news was that, *“a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.”* **Exodus 1:8**
- This king of Egypt schemes to control the Israelites in two ways: First, *“they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.”* **Exodus 1:11**

**Bible Timeline Update**

- Exodus 1:11 is a surprisingly important verse in connection with our Bible timeline.
- Archeologists have determined that the cities of Pithom and Rameses had been under construction much later in history than would fit with the Israelites’ presence in Egypt.
- The documentary by Timothy P. Mahoney, Patterns of Evidence, is highly recommended. This is an excellent look, not only at the issues involved with dating the Exodus, but also for the most reasonable answer to the question of the building of *“Pithom and Rameses.”*

**Enslavement of the Israelites Was Unsuccessful**

- Their enslavement had the opposite effect from the King of Egypt’s plans for them.
- *“The more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites and worked them ruthlessly.”* **Exodus 1:12, 13**
- Pharaoh’s second scheme was one of brutal population control.
    - The Hebrew midwives were instructed to kill any Hebrew boys at birth.
    - This failed, so *“Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: ‘Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.’”* **Exodus 1:22**
- The stage is now set for the story of Moses, born to a Hebrew wife, raised as a prince of Egypt by Pharaoh’s own daughter.
- Moses’ life can be divided into three 40-year periods.

**First 40 years of Moses’ Life**

- The account of his birth is an exciting story.
- He was found and raised by Pharaoh’s daughter.
- He escaped to Midian after he killed an Egyptian who was beating one of his fellow Hebrews.

**Second 40 Years of Moses’ Life**

- This time in Moses’ life receives little notice in Scripture as he spent 40 years in exile in Midian tending his father-in-law’s sheep.
- Moses married and had two sons: Gershom and Eliezer. **Exodus 2:22; 18:4**

**Moses’ Final 40 Years**

- Begins with God’s call to him from a burning bush to go back to Egypt and lead
the Israelites to freedom. Exodus 3
- Near the beginning of this time were the 10 plagues that are a judgment on the
*“gods of Egypt”* **(Exodus 12:12)** and the institution of the Passover.
- After Pharaoh releases the Israelites, there is the miraculous parting of the Sea, the arrival at Mt. Sinai, the giving of the Law and the journey to the edge of the Promised Land where the people, through unbelief, fail to enter.
- The rest of Moses’ final 40 years are spent in the wilderness as the generation who came out of Egypt dies.
- The book of Deuteronomy covers a short period of time and contains Moses’ final speeches to his people before he yields leadership to Joshua.

**Moses is a Very Strong Type of Christ**

- Moses shares in common with Christ both the attempt on his life at birth by an evil king and his choice to identify with his suffering people.
- He was specially set apart as the one God chose to lead His people from slavery to freedom.
- Moses is a flawed man, so not everything about him foreshadows Jesus.
- His first attempt to help his people ended in disaster as he killed an Egyptian.
- He was rejected with the rebuke of a fellow Hebrew, *“Who made you ruler and judge over us?”* **Exodus 2:14**. Even in this Scripture identifies him as a foreshadowing of Christ.
- In **Acts 7:27**, the martyr Stephen, directly relates the Hebrews’ rejection of Moses’ leadership with their rejection of Christ.
- Moses’ 40 years as an unknown shepherd could be compared to Jesus’ relative obscurity from his birth to the beginning of his public ministry at around age 30.
- Scripture focuses most of its attention on Moses’ final 40 years.

The *“Angel of the LORD”* in *“Flames of Fire from Within the Bush”* **(Exodus 3:2)**

- This conversation that follows is worth consideration.
- Most conservative Bible scholars take the term *“angel of the LORD”* to be a reference to the pre-incarnate Jesus.
- In most English Bibles, when God’s name is printed LORD with all capitals this
represents the Hebrew word *“YHWH”* – pronounced *“Yahweh.”*
- The word *“angel”* means messenger, but in the unique circumstances surrounding
these appearances, we are led to suspect that the person referred to is actually
Jesus.
- In this case the narrative quickly leads Moses and all who read the story to the
conclusion that this *“angel of the LORD”* is the *“I AM.”*
- In **Exodus 3:4** we read, *“When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush.”*
- Next Moses was instructed: *“Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground”* **Exodus 3:5**
- In **Exodus 3:7**, where we read, *“The LORD said,”* it is clear that the one speaking to Moses, *“the angel of the LORD,”* is certainly the LORD God.
- This was confirmed later when Moses asked, *“Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”* **Exodus 3:13**
- God answers, *“I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”* **Exodus 3:14**
- An important study of the Hebrew Scriptures would be to examine the other appearances of *“the angel of the LORD”*, to be able to recognize the presence of the eternal Son of God throughout the history of God’s dealings with His covenant
people.
- This would be especially helpful with this survey as we learn to see Jesus throughout the Old Testament.

**The Intense Struggle Between Moses and Pharaoh**

- Moses reluctantly agrees to God’s mission for him.
- This struggle was clearly between Pharaoh and the LORD for the release of the Israelites from captivity.
- **Exodus 12:12** states that the 10 plagues visited upon Egypt directly correspond to the various deities of Egypt.
    - The Egyptians worshiped the Nile (as the source of their provision) and various animistic gods including the sun (whom they believed controlled the weather).
    - They were taught to worship Pharaoh and his children as gods, making the final judgment of the death of the firstborn the climax of all the judgments.

**The Hebrew Feast of the Passover**

- The feast refers back to the night the LORD *“passed over”* the homes of the Hebrews who had put the blood of a sacrificed lamb *“on the sides and tops of the door frames”* of their homes. **Exodus 12:7-13**
- Throughout Egypt, the LORD struck down *“every firstborn – both men and animals,”* **Exodus 12:12**
- The importance of this event in the history of God’s people cannot be overstated.
- This night was to signified the birth of their nation, the first day of their national calendar, and was to be solemnly remembered for all generations to come.
- This sacrifice is also a *“type”* of Christ.
- At Jesus’ baptism, John the Baptist cried out, *“Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.”* **John 1:29**
- The Apostle Paul states, *“Christ, our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.”* **1 Corinthians 5:7**
- Peter, referring to the Passover lamb says, *“For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed...but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.”* **1 Peter 1:18-19**

**The LORD Delivers His People**

- After the Israelites are freed, God leads them to the edge of the Red Sea where the waters are miraculously parted and they walk through the midst of the sea *“on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.”* **Exodus 14:29**
- *“The entire army”* of Egypt was swept away and *“not one of them survived.”* **Exodus 14:28**
- In **1 Corinthians 10:1-7**, Paul says that the Israelites were actually *“baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,”* and that these things were *“types to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things.”*
- The powerful presence of the Lord in delivering his people is to leave a deep and lasting impression on even the church today *“to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.”* **1 Corinthians 10:6**
- Even as they left the slavery of Egypt in freedom, the Hebrews were yet slaves of
sin.
- Even though the LORD had passed over their blood-smeared doors, they had yet to learn the depth of their personal need of God.
- As they traveled to Mt. Sinai, freed by the grace and goodness and power of God,they had yet to hear His voice and learn His ways and enter into the covenant of the Law.

**Review**

- We see in the first two 40-year periods of Moses’ life that Moses was a type of Christ, even in the unique circumstances of his birth.
- After fleeing from Pharaoh at age 40 and spending 40 years as a shepherd, he is the LORD’s chosen servant to lead his people out of slavery.
- The 10 plagues that eventually convinced Pharaoh to release the Hebrews were actually judgments against the false gods of Egypt.
- The Passover typified Christ as the Passover Lamb, pointing clearly to the sacrifice of Christ, the Lamb of God, *“who takes away the sin of the world.”* **John 1:29**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will survey the events of the giving of the Law at Mt. Sinai as the people of Israel enter into the great covenant of the Law, the Old Testament.
- We will see the mighty presence of God as He declares His righteous commands for the good of His people.
- We will learn of God’s provision for His people through sacrifice.

## Key Verses

**(Exodus 1:7-22, 2:14-22, 3:2-14, 12:7-13, 14:28-29, 18:4; John 1:29; Acts 7:27; 1 Corinth 5:7, 10:1-7; 1 Peter 1:18-19)**

## Class Exercise

Be prepared to discuss the KNOW, ARE ABLE TO and WILL BE THINKING ABOUT statements from this session that appear at the beginning of this session in your guidebook.

This is not required. Your instructor may want to purchase a copy of the documentary patterns of Evidence by Timothy P. Mahoney and show it to the class. The video is approx. 2 hours.

If you do this, look at it with regard to the dating of the Exodus and the building of *“Pithom and Rameses.”*

Patterns of Evidence product description: *“Did the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt really happen? There’s evidence that it did! Traveling from the United States to Israel and England, filmmaker Timothy Mahoney sifts through archaeological and historical clues, as well as comments from scholars and experts, to determine the truth as he builds a new case for an ancient – and often controversial – story.”*
