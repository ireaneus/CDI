**Begin video.**

**Review of the Previous Session**

- The period of time between Creation and the Flood.
- Sin enters the World.
- Decline of the human race into ungodliness and the drastic judgment of God.

**Noah's Name**

- Noah sounds like the Hebrew word for *“comfort.”*
- Lamech said when he named Noah: *“He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.”* **Genesis 5:29**
- Noah’s name reminds us of both the curse of sin and the hope of God's help.
- The first use of *“grace”* in Scripture is in Genesis 6:8 after God declared his intent to *“wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth...for I am grieved that I have made them.”* **Genesis 6:7**
- Noah is an early reminder that God's grace to preserve mankind would come through a person.
- God is gracious even when He must judge sin.
- Mankind exists today because *“Noah found favor (grace) in the eyes of the Lord.”* **Genesis 6:8**

**The Righteousness of Noah**

- *“Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.”* **Genesis 6:9.**
- In all of Scripture this is said of only Noah and his great-grandfather, Enoch.
- In contrast to Noah, who *“walked with God”* **(Genesis 6:9)** is the description of the wickedness and violence of mankind. See **Genesis 6:3-7, 11-13**
- It’s important to remember, even though Noah was *“righteous”* and *“blameless”*, he was still subject to death because of Adam's sin.
- Noah's righteousness was the righteousness that comes by faith.
- His faith is seen in his walking obedience with God: he did all God said in building the Ark, gathering the animals, waiting for permission to leave the Ark, building an altar, and offering sacrifices of gratitude after the Flood.
- In Hebrews 11, Noah is described as a man of faith, who, *“in holy fear built an Ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness that is in keeping with faith.”* **Hebrews 11:7**

**God's Presence in Noah's Story**

- Jesus said, *“These are the Scriptures that testify about Me.”* **John 5:39**
- We need to look for Jesus' presence in Noah's story.
- God grieved over the corruption of mankind, who had been created in His image,
but whose thoughts were *“only evil all the time.”* **Genesis 6:5**
- God must have also grieved for an earth *“full of violence,”* **Genesis 6:11** for victims as well as the violent, who *“had corrupted their ways.”* **Genesis 6:12**
- The Lord provided a way to save people by obedient faith.

**Noah Typifies Jesus**

- Noah is a type of Jesus in his obedience. God describes him as *“blameless”*, as one who *“did everything just as God commanded him.”* **Genesis 6:22, 7:5**
- Noah was instructed to *“finish the Ark to within 18-inches of the top.”* (Genesis 6:16) The word *“finish”* is instructive when we remember the *“finished”* work of Christ on the cross.
- The Apostle Peter calls Noah *“a preacher of righteousness.”* **2 Peter 2:5**
- Noah belongs in the line of prophets leading to the greatest prophet, Jesus.
- There was not only room in the Ark for all the animals and the food to keep them alive, but also for a multitude of people who never came.
- Those who came were saved from the world wide destruction of the Flood by God's grace through Noah's obedience.
- In much of Noah's story, we could see testimony of Jesus.

**The Ark Noah Built**

- The Lord's plans were not specific about the overall appearance or external
features, but it was to have *“an opening”* and *“a door.”* **Genesis 6:16**
- The Ark was measured in cubits (thought to be approximately 18 inches)
- The Ark was made of wood (the meaning of Hebrew word translated *“cypress
wood”* is uncertain.)
- Using an 18-inch cubit, the Ark was 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high.
Studies show these dimensions to be optimal for the stability of a large water craft.
- The Lord instructed Noah to *“make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and
out.”* **Genesis 6:14**
- This enabled the Ark to bring those who entrusted themselves to it safely from a
world of destruction to a new world.
- The Lord's instructions were clear that the Ark would have only one door.

**Noah's Story Illustrates Salvation through Jesus Christ**

- In **John 10:7**, Jesus said he was *“the gate (KJV, “the door”)*.
- His words call to mind the one entrance to the Ark of safety. Later, Jesus claimed more clearly, *“I tell you the truth, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”* **John 14:6**
- God Himself closed the door of the Ark as the devastation of the Flood began. **Genesis 7:16**
- There is also a connection between the wooden Ark and the wooden cross upon which Jesus died. Each were the perfect means God chose to bring those who trusted themselves to Him from certain destruction into new life.
- The Lord's instruction to *“make rooms in [the Ark]”* **Genesis 6:14** might prepare us for Jesus' statement, *“In my Father's house are many rooms.”* **John 14:2**
- The stable dimensions of the Ark assure of a salvation that is *“finished”* and
*“perfect.”*

**Many Ancient Flood Stories**

- There are flood stories across widely separated cultures.
- Wikipedia lists some of the stories and includes significant elements of each, but calls them parts of each cultures *“religious mythology.”*
- Obvious similarities are a testimony of shared history.
- Remember that **Genesis 6-9** is the true record *“given by inspiration of God”* (2 Timothy 3:16), and the other accounts are corrupted forms of the original.
- Many comparable details in the stories, even though no written record of contact between distant cultures exists, is a strong testimony to a common history.

**The Actual Flood**

- The factual basis for a worldwide flood has been debated for centuries.
- The detailed month and day record require us to understand this as an eyewitness account.
- **Genesis 7-8** are almost like an ancient ship's log or diary of the Flood.
- It’s a tragedy that many have failed to believe the Biblical account of the
tremendous event by which *“the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.”* **2 Peter 3:6**
- **Genesis 7:11** reveals that *“all the springs of the great deep burst forth and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.”*
- In the history of this planet, nothing like this has happened since the Flood.
- Everywhere on Earth, evidences of this world-wide cataclysm are seen even today:
    - Multiple layers of sediments filled with fossilized remains of millions of sea and land creatures.
    - Tremendous mountain ranges and canyons on every continent deniable only by those who choose not to see.
- These evidences are testimony to the wrath of God against sin and strong warning
of an even greater future judgment. **2 Peter 3:3-12**

**The Flood – A Worldwide Event**

- The Flood completely covered and transformed the surface of the entire planet:*“For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits. Every living thing that moved on land perished – birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left and those with him in the Ark. The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days."*

**Genesis 7:17-24**

- Nearly unimaginable destruction.
- During the creation week, God created *“seas”* (plural) and *“dry land”* (singular). It is reasonable to suggest that the original land mass was broken up and the continents of today were formed.
- The opinion of unbelieving geologists is that the world's tallest mountain ranges
are relatively *“young.”* These heights are made of bent and twisted sedimentary rock containing fossilized sea creatures.
- This is strong testimony of the Flood, the movement of the continents and the young age of the mountains and of the rest of the earth.

**Review**

- Events recorded in **Genesis 6-9** referred to in the rest of Scripture as actual and
historical-notably by the Lord Jesus himself.
- The Flood is the best and most reasonable explanation for the continents and landforms of today.
- Mankind spared annihilation, because one man found “favor” in God’s sight.
- A Biblical understanding of the Flood is powerful testimony pointing to the grace and salvation found in *“the man, Christ Jesus.”* **1 Tim. 2:5b**
- Memorize **Hebrews 11:7**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- Look at the generations from Noah to Abraham.
- See in the events of Babel the explanation for the languages and nations of the
earth.
- The declining ages of people after the flood.
- God’s choosing of a particular man. **Genesis 12:3**.
- See that one of the effects of the Flood was the Ice Age that occurred in the several succeeding centuries.
