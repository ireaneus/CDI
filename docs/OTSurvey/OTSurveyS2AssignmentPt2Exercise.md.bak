## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.52)*

Benjamin as a Type of Christ.

- **An introduction or illustration as to the why this type was chosen and its’importance.** For example: *“From the earliest history of God’s chosen people, one man stands out as the Savior of his people. He is an unappreciated prophet, falsely accused and mistreated and yet rises to become God’s means of rescuing the children of Abraham from certain death.”*
- **A Thesis statement** - This is one sentence stating the importance of the Type and what it teaches. For example: *“Joseph: One of many brothers, exalted through suffering set apart for the salvation of his people.”*
- **Outline** – Several main points of the lesson or sermon that the student would want to make. For example:
  - I. Joseph: Unappreciated Dreamer and Prophet
  - II. Joseph: Falsely Accused yet faithful
  - III. Joseph: Exalted to Save His people
- **Conclusion** – A final restatement of the Thesis and the importance of this Biblical Type. For example: Hidden in plain sight, in the first book of the Bible, is one of the greatest revelations of the future suffering and ultimate success of the Promised One who would *“Save his people from their sins.”*

## Class Exercise

## Benjamin: Son of Sorrow, Son of the Right Hand — A Type of Christ

### 📖 Introduction / Illustration

In a seemingly quiet moment along a difficult journey, a woman dies giving birth to her son. Her dying breath names him Ben-oni, *"Son of My Sorrow."* But his father renames him Benjamin, *"Son of the Right Hand."* This simple but profound episode in Genesis 35 holds within it a prophetic shadow of the Messiah. Born of a favored woman, Ben-oni bears the sorrow of childbirth and death, but Benjamin, renamed in exaltation, silently stands as a type of Christ. In his names, his heritage, and his placement in redemptive history, Benjamin reveals profound truths about the suffering and glorified Christ.

### ✍️ Thesis Statement

Benjamin, the final son of Jacob’s beloved wife, stands as a prophetic type of Christ — first as the Man of Sorrows, then as the Exalted Son at the Right Hand.

### 📂 Outline

**I. Ben-oni: The Son of Sorrow**

- Rachel names him Ben-oni — *“Son of my sorrow”* — as she dies in childbirth **(Gen. 35:18)**.
- Reflects Christ in His first coming: *“A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief”* **(Isa. 53:3)**.
- Rachel’s death highlights the cost of bringing forth life, just as Christ’s mission required suffering and death.

**II. Benjamin: The Son of the Right Hand**

- Jacob renames him Benjamin — *“Son of the right hand.”*
- Symbolizes Christ’s resurrection and exaltation to the right hand of God **(Heb. 1:3; Acts 2:33)**.
- The name shift encapsulates Christ’s twofold mission: first in humility, then in glory.

**III. The Favored Woman: Rachel as a Type of Mary**

- Rachel is the beloved wife of Jacob, just as Mary is called *“highly favored”* **(Luke 1:28)**.
- Both births are surrounded by divine purpose and prophetic sorrow **(Gen. 30:22–24; Luke 2:34–35)**.
- Highlights God's redemptive work coming through chosen vessels of favor.

**IV. Bethlehem: A Shared Birthplace of Pain and Promise**

- Benjamin is born near Bethlehem (Gen. 35:19) — the same [location](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWX979KS) where Christ is born **(Mic. 4:8, 5:2; Matt. 2:1)**.
- Yet Bethlehem becomes the place of Messianic hope, showing that out of sorrow comes salvation.

**V. The Second Son: A Picture of the Last Adam and Greater Favor**

- Benjamin is the second son of Rachel, born through sorrow but renamed in glory — a type of Christ as the Last Adam **(1 Cor. 15:45)**.
- The biblical pattern of the second son bringing redemption (Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, David over his brothers) finds fulfillment in Jesus, and Benjamin echoes that pattern.

### 🏁 Conclusion

Hidden in the final pages of Rachel’s life is a striking prophecy of Christ’s redemptive mission. In Ben-oni, we see the suffering Savior. In Benjamin, we see the glorified Lord. His birth near Bethlehem, his connection to a favored mother, and his honored status as Rachel’s second son point forward to Jesus — the Last Adam, who bore our sorrow and now reigns in glory. Benjamin stands as a quiet yet powerful revelation of the promised Redeemer — the One who transforms sorrow into salvation.
