## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.70)*

You will KNOW:

- Genesis 1 and 2 are the critical foundation for all of Scripture.
- When we believe God's Word from its very beginning, we can expect to succeed in believing and teaching the rest of it.

You will be ABLE TO:

- Discuss the historical nature and straightforward meaning of these chapters and of all of Genesis.

You will THINK ABOUT:

- What God intends us to know about how and when He created and just how long it took Him to do so.

**Begin video.**

**Certainties of the Account of Creation**

- Along with the mysteries of the events of creation come certainties.
- **Foundational class on Bibliology**: *God's own definition of His inspired Word and hermeneutics, or the science of interpretation of written words.*
- God's Word is meant to be understood and believed.
- Scripture cannot be wrong, nor are there multiple correct interpretations.
- God wants us to know what He has said and what His Word means.

**Human Authors**

- The Bible’s human authors wrote in their individual languages and with their individual writing styles.
- There are many types of literature in Scripture: history, story, poetry, prophecy.
- It’s important to recognize these in our study of Scripture.
- Genesis is an account of historical events.
- Events are concisely recorded in years, genealogies and even in days and months (the Flood).
- In the first 11 chapters of Genesis, Moses recorded a straightforward narrative of history.

**Historical Narrative**

- Conveys the *“What,” “Where,” Who,” and “When”* of the events in Genesis --not primarily concerned with *“Why.”*
- The first 11 chapters are concise, *“God-breathed”* answers to those questions:
    - What: God created everything from nothing and it was all good.
    - Where: Everywhere and specifically on this planet.
    - Who: Elohim, the first man and woman and their descendants and the serpent.
    - When: Clearly, about 6,000 years ago, creation was completed in six days.

**Modern Interpretations**

- *“Science has proved that the universe is billions of years old.”*
- *“The author of Genesis didn't know what we know today.”* (Who, ultimately, is the Author of Genesis?)
- *“A day doesn't always mean 24 hours.” 2 Peter 3:8 says, “With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.”*
- *“It's all a matter of interpretation.”*
- Peter said that God's Word is not open to *“any private interpretation.”* **2 Peter 1:20, (NKJV)**
- There may be many *“interpretations,”* but there is only one correct interpretation.

**“Day” in Genesis**

- Peter is referencing **Psalm 90:4**. Moses is the author of Psalm 90 and Genesis.
- Many meanings for *“day,”* but when modified by a number, as in *“first day,”* *“second day,”* etc. *“day”* in Scripture always means a span of 24 hours.
- God also included the phrase *“the evening and the morning.”*
- *“Day”* in Genesis 1 means a 24-hour time period.
- Seven consecutive 24-hour periods is creation from start to finish!

**Ignorance of the “Author of Genesis”?**

- God inspired Moses’ writing.
- Even though he had access to the libraries of Egypt as well as the verbal history of his ancestors, his words bear the mark of *“inspired by God,”* who was the eyewitness to creation.

**“Science has Proved...”**

- *“Science”* simply means *“knowledge”* and is constantly being revised and tested.
- If we begin by believing God's Word, we can look at our world and the universe with the only true foundation – To do otherwise cannot be wise. **Romans 1:21-22**

**Recommended Reading**

- *“24 Hours – Plain as Day,”* by Jud Davis, April 1, 2012 (Reprinted with permission in your guidebook) and also available on the Answers in Genesis website [https://www.answersingenesis.org/days-of-creation/24-hours-plain-as-day/](https://www.answersingenesis.org/days-of-creation/24-hours-plain-as-day/)
- Davis makes the well-researched claim that, *“the top Hebrew scholars all agree that the writer of Genesis 1 intended the word ‘day’ to mean 24 hours.”*
- It’s interesting that these *“top scholars”* do not believe that God created the world in six days. They do, however, know what their language clearly says.

**Required Readings**

- *“The New Answers Book”* chapter 8, *“Could God Really Have Created Everything in Six Days?”* by Ken Ham. Reprinted with permission in your guidebook. Also on the Answers in Genesis website [https://www.answersingenesis.org/days-of-creation/could-god-really-have-created-everything-in-six-days/](https://www.answersingenesis.org/days-of-creation/could-god-really-have-created-everything-in-six-days/)
- Links to additional articles are embedded on the website version.

**Seeing Jesus in the Hebrew Scriptures**

- Jesus is the Word who created and sustains all things.
- He is the one *“who is, and who was, and is to come, the Almighty.”* **Revelation 1:8**
- His own words are the ultimate authority for the interpretation of His work in creation.
- Nearly half of Jesus' quotes from the Hebrew Scriptures come from Genesis and these never give any other than a sense of actual historical events.
- Jesus referred to Adam and Eve as having been made *“at the beginning of creation”* (Matthew 19:4). He confirmed the beginning of humanity, but also verified the timescale in the genealogies of Genesis 5, 10 and 11.

**A Word of Encouragement**

- Public education has indoctrinated many of us with evolution and the concept of millions of years.
- The video instructor is convinced Biblically of a 6,000-year timeframe for the age of the earth.
- He has also been convinced by his reading in Archeology, Geology, Astronomy, Genetics and Anthropology, that there is no reason to believe the earth and universe are older than the Bible’s revealed history of 6,000 years.
- Knowing this brings the world and God's plans and His purposes in redemption more clearly into focus.

**Preview of the Next Session**

The genealogies of Genesis 5, 10 and 11 provide an accurate framework for understanding the early history of the earth.

## Class Exercise

Be prepared to discuss the KNOW, ARE ABLE TO and WILL BE THINKING ABOUT statements from this session that appear at the beginning of this session in your guidebook.

Read “24 Hours – Plain as Day,” by Jud Davis, April 1, 2012, also included in this guide by permission.

Be prepared to discuss the disconnect between understanding the meaning of the text and believing it.

Read *“The New Answers Book”*, Chapter 8, “Could God Really Have Created Everything in Six Days?” by Ken Ham (also included in this guide by permission)

## Why did God take so long

**Exodus 20:11**

> For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. *Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.*

**Exodus 31:12** *says that God commanded Moses to say to the children of Israel:*

> *"Six days may work be done, but on the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Therefore, the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant. It is a sign between me and the sons of Israel forever. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed"* **(Exodus 31:15–17).**

- *He set the example for man.*
- *dying, you will die*
- *Hebrews 9:22: And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.*
- light and darkness were created in a space, or they were contained as it were *evening and day* earth's rotation.
- 2 Peter 3:8 a *"day"* is *"like"* a *"thousand"* years in reference to the 2nd coming of Christ. thousand years as one day

> 8 But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord *one day is like a thousand years*, and a *thousand years like one day*.

**Hebrews 4:3-4**

> For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: *"So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest'", although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works..."

**Martin Luther once said:**

> *"I have often said that whoever would study Holy Scripture should be sure to see to it that he stays with the simple words as long as he can and by no means departs from them unless an article of faith compels him to understand them differently. For of this we must be certain: no clearer speech has been heard on Earth than what God has spoken."*

*"If the present sense makes common sense, seek no other sense."*

Because God is infinite in power and wisdom, there’s no doubt He could have created the universe and its contents in no time at all, or six seconds, or six minutes, or six hours—after all, with God nothing shall be impossible **(Luke 1:37).**

## Luther and Calvin 6 ordinary days

In Martin Luther’s day, some of the church fathers were saying that God created everything in only one day or in an instant. Martin Luther wrote,

> *"When Moses writes that God created Heaven and Earth and whatever is in them in six days, then let this period continue to have been six days, and do not venture to devise any comment according to which six days were one day. But, if you cannot understand how this could have been done in six days, then grant the Holy Spirit the honor of being more learned than you are. For you are to deal with Scripture in such a way that you bear in mind that God Himself says what is written. But since God is speaking, it is not fitting for you want only to turn His Word in the direction you wish to go."*

Similarly, John Calvin stated,

> *“Albeit the duration of the world, now declining to its ultimate end, has not yet attained six thousand years. ... God’s work was completed not in a moment but in six days.”*

| **Biblical account of creation** | **Evolutionary / Long-age speculation** |
| :------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
| Earth before the sun and stars | Stars and sun before earth |
| Earth covered in water initially | Earth a molten blob initially |
| Oceans first, then dry land  | Dry land, then the oceans |
| Life first created on the land | Life started in the oceans |
| Plants created before the sun | Plants came long after the sun |
| Land animals created after birds | Land animals existed before birds |
| Whales before land animals | Land animals before whales |

Be prepared to discuss alternative views of the days of creation.

Study Peter's reference in 2 Peter 3:8 to Psalm 90:4 comparing a day to a thousand years. Know that Moses is the author of Psalm 90 and Genesis.
