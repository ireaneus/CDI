## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.192)*

You will KNOW:

- The three reasons Solomon was such an important king.

You will be ABLE TO:

- Compare God’s answer to Solomon’s first prayer **(1 Kings 3:11-14)**, with God’s answer to Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple. **1 Kings 9:3-9**

You will THINK ABOUT:

- Solomon as a type of Christ – see **1 Corinthians 1:30 and Colossians 2:3.**

**Begin video.**

**In The Previous Session**

- Saw King David’s great successes and also the depths of the terrible consequences of sin.
- Learned of David’s preparations for his son Solomon’s building of the Temple.

**Preview**

- This lesson is about Solomon’s reign from 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9.

**Why So Much on the Life and Reign of Solomon?**

- First: He, as David’s son, is the initial expected fulfillment of the prophecy that David would have a son whose throne would be established forever. **2 Samuel 7:13**
- Second: Solomon is famous for his wisdom. He is a type of the One *“who has become for us wisdom from God – that is our righteousness, holiness and redemption.”* **(1 Corinthians 1:30)** Solomon is a type of Christ, *“in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”* **Colossians 2:3**
- Third: *Solomon was uniquely gifted by God to author the books of Proverbs, the Song of Solomon and Ecclesiastes, at least two of the Psalms and possibly the book of Job*.

**Solomon, Son of David**

- Look at the man himself and his relationship with his father and brothers.
- Accomplishments of his reign – building the Temple.
- God’s choice to sit on David’s throne.
- Expectations for his reign in light of the promises of God.

**Details of Solomon’s Elevation to Kingship**

- 1 Kings gives details and 1 Chronicles gives insight.
- David reveals that it is Solomon who is God’s choice to sit on the throne and build the *“house.”* **1 Chronicles 28:4-7**
- David’s 8th son, at best. David’s firstborn, Amnon, and third (or fourth) son, Absalom were killed in the wake of the family turmoil following David’s sin.
- Solomon’s name means *“Shalom”* or *“peace”*, he was also called *“Jedidiah”* – *“loved by the LORD.”* **2 Samuel 12:24-25.**
- 1 Kings begins with Solomon’s older brother, Adonijah, seeking the throne.
- David is still alive and confirms his son Solomon as king.
- After a failed plot to gain the throne, Adonijah is executed along with his coconspirator, Joab, the commander of the army.
- By *Chapter 3 of 1 Kings*, Solomon is firmly established as King and his reign really begins. (At this point the *2 Chronicles account begins*.)
- The LORD appears to Solomon at the beginning of his reign and says, *“Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”* **1 Kings 3:5**
- Solomon humbly recognizes the great responsibilities before him and his request for wisdom pleases the LORD, who promises: *I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be. Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for – both wealth and honor – so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings. And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life.* **1 Kings 3:12-14**

**Solomon’s Reign**

- The stage is set for the reign of the son of David that seems, at first, to be the hope of the fulfillment of the promises of Abraham: A great nation and a blessing to all the nations.
- God’s promised son of David whose throne would be established forever and the LORD’s anointed to fulfill the hopes of Israel.
- Solomon was the hope of Israel.
- Solomon begins the fulfillment of his father’s plans for the Temple – a 7-year project requiring all the resources of the nation. Nearly 200,000 men were in the workforce and the project required international cooperation.

**Old Testament Timeline Sidelight**

- An important anchor verse for the Timeline: *“In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign...he began to build the Temple of the LORD.”* **1 Kings 6:1**
- **2 Chronicles 3:1* gives the intriguing detail that the Temple was built *“on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David.”*
- This was one of the mountains in the region where Abraham offered his son Isaac.
- Looking forward, this will be the vicinity, or perhaps the very place, where God, himself, will provide the Lamb.

**Solomon’s Builds the Temple and His House**

- The Temple will follow the pattern of the Tabernacle that Moses built and will speak of the person of Christ and foreshadow his incarnation.
- Dimensions and materials are given in great detail as were those of the Tabernacle.
- The splendor of Solomon’s Temple will be the center piece of his reign.
- The Temple’s interior and furnishings contained unimaginable wealth. Sadly this central place of worship for Israel will be misused by many in the future.
- The Temple was blessed by God at its dedication, but the true Temple God would have us seek, was never made by the hands of men. **1 Kings 8:27**
- Remember, Jesus said, *“Destroy this Temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”* *“But the Temple he had spoken of was his body.”* **(John 2:19, 21)** Later, Paul recognizes the church as *“the body of Christ”* **(1 Corinthians 12:27)** and individual believers as his Temple. **1 Corinthians 6:19**
- An important and telling contrast in **1 Kings 6:38 and in 1 Kings 7:1**, where we read that Solomon spent 7 years building the Temple and then, *“It took Solomon 13 years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.”*
- It seems that something had *“shifted”* in Solomon’s priorities. This becomes clearer as time passes.

**Solomon a Powerful King**

- After completion and dedication of the Temple, the Lord appears to Solomon a second time. This time the LORD’s message in *1 Kings 9:3-9* is much more *“conditional”* and carries a strong note of warning.
- Solomon’s story describes his fabulous prosperity and the reach of his power.
- *“King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women.”* **1 Kings 11:1**
- He directly disobeyed the LORD’s command, and *“had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines, and his wives led him astray.”* **1 Kings 11:3**
- These wives *“turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.”* **1 Kings 11:4**
- Once again, the hope of a righteous king, whose kingdom will never end, is foreshadowed and then disappointed.
- The king who will reign on David’s throne must be *“greater than Solomon.”* **Matthew 12:42**

**Solomon’s Legendary Wisdom**

- Many cultures revere him as *“the wisest man who ever lived.”*
- The judgment between two prostitutes early in his reign, drew the comment, *“they saw he had wisdom from God.”* **1 Kings 3:28**
- The building of the Temple, his palace and store-cities required extraordinary organization and planning.
- **1 Kings 4:29-34** is a synopsis of the extent of his curiosity and skill. He was a poet, a musician and a student of plant and animal life.
- *“Men of all nations came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom.”* **1 Kings 4:34**
- Yet for all his wisdom and fame, his life is prime testimony that wisdom is not enough.
- The book of Proverbs, mostly attributed to Solomon, is filled with brilliant and memorable observations about life. The book of Ecclesiastes, revered for its insight, is a gloomy portrayal of life *“under the sun”* with little sense of a heart seeking after righteousness.
- At the conclusion of Ecclesiastes and nearing the end of his life, Solomon writes, *“Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.”* **Ecclesiastes 12:13-14**
- The introduction to the Proverbs warns, *“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.”* **Proverbs 1:7**

**Review**

- The life and reign of Solomon, son of David.
- He was the one chosen by the LORD to inherit the kingdom of his father.
- His responsibility to fulfill David’s plan for a Temple where God would be worshiped at the heart of his kingdom.
- Solomon asked for and received greater wisdom and understanding than all who had come before him.
- He accomplished tremendous projects and was a student of literature and nature.
- Solomon was the expected fulfillment of the hopes of Israel for one whose reign would be without end and bring blessing to all the world. However, for all his wisdom and knowledge, he was just a man.
- He was another sign-post on the way to the One who must be *“greater than Solomon;”* One who will be for us *“wisdom and righteousness and holiness and redemption.”* **1 Corinthians 1:30**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- Look at the kings and prophets in the rest of 1 and 2 Kings and, from a different perspective, in 2 Chronicles 10-36.
- The history of the Israelites after Solomon’s death is one of division and decline.
- Some kings will follow in the ways of David and more who will follow the example of Solomon’s later years.
- The hope of a righteous King remains and there is much to learn of his truth and power so that we might recognize him when he arrives.
