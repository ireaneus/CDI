**Review of the Previous Session**

- We looked at the Psalms as the hymnal of the Bible.
- The 150 poems were not only written to be sung, but included which instruments to use.
- We don’t know what the music sounded like, but names of the melodies like; *“The Death of the Son,”* (**Psalm 9**), and *“Do Not Destroy,”* (**Psalm 57**), suggest a mournful sound.
- Other melodies such as *“Lilies,”* (**Psalm 45**), and *“A Dove On Distant Oaks,”* (**Psalm 56**), suggest a more pleasant tone.
- Words of some Psalms can suggest their own melodies;
    - Psalm 95 begins, *“Come let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.”* This sounds pretty happy!
    - On the other hand, *“By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion,”* (**Psalm 137:1**) pleads for a sad tune.
- We also discussed the various forms of Hebrew poetry, which include three ways of rhyming thoughts instead of word-sounds.
- We briefly discussed acrostic and chiastic forms of arranging verse.
- Within the five books of the Psalms are groupings around certain themes.
- The final five Psalms are the *“Hallelujah”* Psalms which build to Psalm 150 that begins with *“Praise the LORD!”* and ends with *“Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!”*

**Messianic Psalms**

- Scattered through the songs of the Hebrews are Psalms that clearly speak of Jesus.
- Although we have seen that Jesus is present in all of the Scriptures, the Messianic Psalms are typically those that are quoted in the New Testament and directly fulfilled in Jesus’ life and ministry.
- *“Those in which David, describing his outward and inward experiences, experiences even in themselves typical, is carried beyond the limits of his individuality and present condition, and utters concerning Himself that which, transcending human experience, is intended to become historically true only in Christ.”* Old Testament Commentary by Keil and Delitzsch

**Psalms That Predict Jesus’ Sufferings**

- Psalm 34, an acrostic which, as the inscription tells us, was written in response to a near fatal disaster as David fled from King Saul. **1 Samuel 21**
- David rejoices in the LORD’s deliverance and says, *“The righteous person may have many troubles, but the LORD delivers him from them all; He protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.”* **Psalm 34:19-20**
- The Apostle John, speaking of Jesus’ crucifixion, remembers the Scriptures predicted that *“Not one of his bones shall be broken.”* **John 19:36**
- This is one small example how the life of David would be a type of Christ and Jesus the anti-type.

**Psalms and the Final Hours Before the Crucifixion**

- In Psalm 41:9, David says, *“Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.”* Jesus said, in **John 13:18**, that Judas’ betrayal happened to fulfill these words of Scripture.
- In **John 15:25**, Jesus said that the words of **Psalm 69:4**, *“Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head,”* were fulfilled in the hatred the world had toward him.
- Psalm 69:9 says *“zeal for your house consumes me”* and this was fulfilled in **John 2:17**.
- In Psalm 69:21, David says, *“They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.”* This was fulfilled in **Matthew 27:34**.

**Psalms Explanation of Why Jesus Offered Himself for Our Salvation**

- Psalm 40:6-8, is quoted in the book of Hebrews as the explanation why Jesus offered himself for our salvation.
- **Hebrews 10:4** says that because *“it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins,”* Jesus came in the flesh to offer himself for us.
- The writer of Hebrews quotes from the LXX version of Psalm 40 and explains:
    - When Christ came into the world, he said, *“Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body You prepared for Me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings You were not pleased.”* Then I said, *“Here I am—it is written about Me in the scroll—I have come to do Your will, my God.”* **Hebrews 10:5-7**

**Psalm 22 – Dramatic and Specific Psalm of the Suffering Savior**

- Psalm 22 is an ancient hymn of David set to the tune of *“The Doe of the Morning,”* in which there is the anguished cry of the forsaken.
- The first two-thirds is a picture of Christ’s death with more detail than the accounts of eye-witnesses in the gospels.
- Jesus cried the words of David from the cross, *“My God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?”* **Matthew 27:46**
- The mocking priests and elders repeated the words of Psalm 22:8, *“He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue Him.”* **Matthew 27:43**
- Psalm 22:14-17 is recognized as an accurate and graphic description of the physical agony of crucifixion:
    - *I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted within me. My mouth is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death. Dogs surround me, a pack of villains encircles me; they pierce my hands and my feet. All my bones are on display; people stare and gloat over me.*
- Notice verse 16 states specifically, *“they have pierced my hands and my feet,”* then in verse 18, we read *“they divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.”* It’s almost as if the Psalmist could see the soldiers at the foot of the cross. (**John 19:24**)
- From verses 22-31, the melody seems to change with a definite and increasing note of victory. The victory of the sufferer is not only for himself, but others are called to share in it.
- Countering the opening cry of Psalm 22, verses 24-25 say, *“For He has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; He has not hidden His face from him but has listened to his cry for help. From You comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear You I will fulfill my vows.”*
- The Psalm ends, *“Posterity will serve Him; future generations will be told about the Lord. They will proclaim His righteousness, declaring to a people yet unborn: He has done it!”* **Psalm 22:30-31**
- *“He has done it!”* may well have been Jesus’ final words from the cross and could be translated, *“It is finished!”* **John 19:30**

**Psalm 88 as a Messianic Psalm**

- Psalm 88 is not traditionally listed as a Messianic Psalm.
- It is a powerful expression of despair and an image of the mental sufferings of Jesus.
- The entire mournful song speaks only of brokenness and rejection.
- If the opening cry of Psalm 22 could be expanded into 18 verses, they would be very similar to the 18 verses of Psalm 88.
- If we allow ourselves to enter into the pain described here by Heman the Ezrahite, how can we not be moved to tears?
- The song descends into the depths of despair and ends with the tragic cry, *“You have taken my companions and loved ones from me; the darkness is my closest friend.”* **Psalm 88:18**
- The mental and emotional anguish of the Lord Jesus were surely the greater torture of the cross as *“God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us.”* **2 Corinthians 5:21**

**Review**

- Messianic Psalms fulfilled in Jesus’ first coming.
- Israel’s great hope was a coming perfect King.
- God promised David a son whose throne would be established forever.
- This became the great hope of the Jews during the next 1,000 years of their suffering. Perhaps David’s mournful songs sustained them through the captivity in Babylon or later when they were conquered by the Greeks and in the time of Christ when they were ruled by the Romans.
- It is no wonder they failed to understand that the Anointed One, who would one day rule with an iron scepter, would first come to die.
- Psalms speaking of the Mighty King of Glory may have offered more hope than the songs of suffering.
- We can look back to see that this Mighty One had a greater kingdom in mind.
- Jesus said to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus: *“How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”* **Luke 24:25-26**
- We have looked at songs that foreshadowed His sufferings.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at the songs of His glory.
