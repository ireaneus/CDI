Begin video.

**Review of the Previous Session**

- We covered the book of Proverbs.
- Have you made Proverbs a regular part of your Bible reading?
- **Instructor note:** *I would like to have stayed longer in Proverbs because of how extensively the Lord has used its principles in my life. I have often pictured many of the individual proverbs as being simply condensed versions of much longer stories.*

**Preview**

- Should be familiar with the poetic forms we saw in Job, Psalms and Proverbs.
- Ecclesiastes use these forms along with sections of prose.
- The Song of Solomon is entirely composed of Hebrew poetry.
- Both books were historically attributed to Solomon in the middle 900’s BC.
- Traditionally the Song of Solomon was thought to have been composed by Solomon as a young man and Ecclesiastes in his final years.

**Views as to When Ecclesiastes was Written**

- Many recent conservative scholars believe it was written after the exile and not by Solomon.
- This argument is based on the idea that words occurring in the book were not introduced into the Hebrew language until after their time in Babylon.
- William MacDonald in his work *The Believer’s Bible Commentary*, (Thomas Nelson) comments on the date and authorship of Ecclesiastes: *“Since the traditional view has never been really disproved – no matter how unpopular it may be at present – we feel it is safest to maintain the Solomonic authorship.”* (p. 876)
- We will take this view as we study.

**Opening Lines of Ecclesiastes**

- *“The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem: ‘Meaningless! Meaningless!’ says the Teacher. ‘Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.’”* **Ecclesiastes 1:1-2**
- This is not an encouraging beginning!
- In the next verse, the phrase *“under the sun”* first appears. It is repeated 23 times in the book and is the setting for all that follows.
- The book assumes an earthbound view, however, God is referred to 42 times.
- The writer gives the sense that man, under heaven, must do the best he can. But we are reminded that God is present and the privilege of responsible action is a gift from Him.
- The name for God used here is *“Elohim;”* the first word in the Genesis. The triune God watches over the affairs of men.

**One Man’s Investigations and Observations About Life “Under the Sun”**

- Solomon had the freedom, finances and ability to satisfy his desire to know how and why life is the way it is.
- His consistent refrain: *“everything is meaningless,”* seems unsettling.
- Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, says the word *“meaningless”* means, *“emptiness or vanity; figuratively something transitory and unsatisfactory.”*
- Awareness of the presence of God gives a sense that there is always something more and better ahead.

**The Teacher’s Opening Remarks – Chapter 1**

- *“There is nothing new under the sun.”* **Ecclesiastes 1:9**
- In the simple facts of living, this is true, man is the same as he has always been. The myth of evolution must be discarded.
- Solomon concludes his opening remarks with, *“For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.”* **Ecclesiastes 1:18**

**The Teacher’s Various Investigations – Chapter 2**

- Solomon examined pleasures of accomplishment and wealth **(Ecclesiastes 2:1-11)**, *“madness and folly”* **(Ecclesiastes 2:12-16)**, the seeming pointlessness of hard work. **Ecclesiastes 2:17-26**
- *“What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?”* **Ecclesiastes 2:22**
- He concluded: *“A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?”* **Ecclesiastes 2:24-25**

**A Time for Everything – Chapter 3**

- Solomon assured his readers that *“there is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.”* **Ecclesiastes 3:1**
- Yet he questions the purpose for this activity and concluded, sadly, *“So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?”* **Ecclesiastes 3:22**

**The Value of Companionship – Chapter 4**

- In **Ecclesiastes 4:7-8** he comments on the bleak state of *“a man all alone”* and then turns his thoughts to the strength found in friendship.
- *“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!”* **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10**

**The Transitory Nature of Power – Chapters 4:13–6:12**

- *“Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.”* **Ecclesiastes 4:13**
- This fits well with what we learned about Solomon’s later years in 1 Kings.
- Next he examines the importance of making and keeping *“vows.”* **Ecclesiastes 5:1-7**
- Then comes a comparison study of poverty and wealth – neither of which offer answers to the purpose of life *“under the sun.”* **Ecclesiastes 5:8–6:12**

**The Value of Wisdom – Chapter 7**

- A longer poem about the value of wisdom. *“Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.”* **Ecclesiastes 7:11**
- He concludes that wisdom is good, that *“wisdom brightens a man’s face and changes its hard appearance.”* **Ecclesiastes 8:1**

**Examination and Comment on Life – Chapters 8–12**

- Solomon continues the pattern of examination and brilliant comment on life.
- There is a constant sense of disappointment and longing: as if true meaning was just beyond reach.
- The powerful conclusion brings us to where true meaning dwells: *“Remember your Creator in the days of your youth.”* **Ecclesiastes 12:1**
- Ecclesiastes 12:1-8 is an eloquent description of the frailty of advanced age.
- Perhaps Solomon saw the approach of the end of his life *“under the sun,”* a life begun in such hope and promise, yet a life poorly ended, he saw where Wisdom truly dwells.
- Our true meaning and purpose are not meant to be temporary and simply *“under heaven”* but rather in heaven in God’s presence who rewards *“each man according to what he has done.”* **Psalm 62:12**
- Solomon concludes: *“Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.”* **Ecclesiastes 12:13**

**The Song of Solomon – Introduction**

- This book is entirely poetic
- It has also been called *“Canticles”* and *“The Song of Songs.”*
- The first verse is its title: *“Solomon’s Song of Songs.”*
- It is intended to be sung, like a dramatic love opera.
- It was likely written in the early years of Solomon’s reign before he became entangled in the politics of royal marriages.
- There are two main characters: The *“most beautiful of women”* **(Song of Solomon 1:8)** and the *“King.”* **Song of Solomon 1:4**
- There are backup singers or a chorus of *“friends”* who sing their comments and encouragement throughout the drama.
- We can imagine various changes or movements as the action rises and falls.
- There are moments of joy and sorrow and introspection and passion in the song that demand changes in volume or tone.

**First Scene**

- Opens with the song of the woman, *“the Beloved,”* who sings her longing for her lover, *“the King”* or *“Lover.”*
- The Beloved has two opening numbers and a short chorus by the *“friends”* follow each one.
- In **Song of Solomon 1:9-11**, the opening scene, the Lover sings a short song praising the beauty of his Beloved.
- The rest of the scene is a duet between the two. Followed by another long song by the Beloved about her wonderful Lover. **Song of Solomon 1:9–2:2**

**Next Scene**

- The beautiful refrain is repeated twice more: *“Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.”* **Song of Solomon 2:7; 3:5; 8:4**
- This appears to be excellent advice for young people about being careful not to arouse the strong passions of sexual desire too early.
- This *“love opera”* ascends and descends through several adventures as the lovers draw nearer to each other.
- This could be a description of the purity of love before sin when *“the man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.”* **Genesis 2:25**

**Various Interpretations of the Song of Solomon**

- It could simply be a love song exalting the wonder of love between a man and a woman.
- It could be the hopeful conclusion of the tumultuous relationship between God and His loved people.
- It could be Christ’s love for his church and the true believer’s longing for *“the wedding supper of the Lamb.”* **Revelation 19:9**
- Ultimately, all love stories are fulfilled in the words of Revelation: *“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.”* **Revelation 21:2-3**

**Review**

- We surveyed the Hebrew wisdom literature in *Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon*.
- We travelled from the depths of Job’s despair to the heights of joy’s love.
- We saw Wisdom personified in Proverbs and we heard her invitation to life and her warnings about ways leading to death.
- We have been given truth that hasn’t changed in 3,000 years.
- We examined life *“under the sun”* with the Teacher in Ecclesiastes, and we have seen that life *“with the Creator”* in mind offers the only true meaning.
- Our Creator is the one who *“loved us and gave himself for us,”* (**Ephesians 5:2**), in whom *“are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”* (**Colossians 2:3**)
- We have learned that we can see Him in the Scriptures on every page if we will look.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at two books that for much of history were considered one book: Ezra and Nehemiah.
- We will take a quick glance at the book of Esther.
- We will finish our survey of the Hebrew Scriptures with the life and prophecies of the great prophet Daniel.
