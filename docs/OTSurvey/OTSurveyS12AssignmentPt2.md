**Review of Previous Session**

- The story of Job is ancient, but the language indicates it was most likely written around the time of Solomon.
- The book of Job is almost entirely in poetic form.
- Job is Hebrew *“Wisdom Literature,”* examining some of the most difficult questions people ask.
- Job and his friends are particularly concerned with *“What causes suffering?”* That question is never directly answered, but conclusions drawn show that suffering has value and that God is sovereign.
- God is not angry with Job about his complaints or questions—in this we see God’s grace.

**Background for Studying Proverbs**

- There are many truths for life taught in Proverbs such as *Humility, Friendship, Generosity, Money, Listening, His Will, Diligence and the Value of Wisdom*.
- *In the early chapters there is a strong sense of a father instructing his son.*
- There are five divisions in the book.
    - Chapters 1–9 which contain longer warnings and exhortations.
    - Chapters 10–24.
    - Chapters 25–29.
    - Chapter 30.
    - Chapter 31.

**Prologue – Proverbs 1:1–7**

- *“The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel.”* **Proverbs 1:1**
- The prologue gives the purpose for the collection:
    For gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair; for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young—let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance. **Proverbs 1:2–5**
- In this prologue is also the theme for the entire book: *“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.”* **Proverbs 1:7**

**First Division of Proverbs – Chapter 1**

- Several interesting features that set it apart from the rest of the book.
- Proverbs 1:8 begins, *“Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.”*
- Fifteen times in the first seven chapters this plea from a father to a son is given, but only eight times in the rest of this book.
- There are several long, connected *“warnings”* on certain themes given in this division.
- Unique feature is that *“Wisdom”* and *“Folly”* are personified as women especially in Chapters 8–9.
- Proverbs 1:8–19 is an intense warning against joining with those who take dishonest paths to riches. This may be a warning against stealing, but cautions that the true riches wisdom offers will not be gained by dishonesty.
- Wisdom is first personified as a woman in Proverbs 1:20–33.
    - *“Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares.”* **Proverbs 1:20**
    - *“How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?”* **Proverbs 1:22**
    - Her plea concludes, *“But whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”* **Proverbs 1:33**

**First Division – Chapter 2**

- Chapter 2 is one long poem of encouragement to a son about the value of wisdom.
- Wisdom is worth extraordinary effort and leads to the knowledge of God. (**Proverbs 2:5**) In God is found wisdom, knowledge, victory and protection. **Proverbs 2:5-8**
- The rest of this poem describes the evils that the wisdom of God will give protection from: *wicked men* (**Proverbs 2:12-15**), and *the adulteress.* (**Proverbs 2:16-19**)
- The strong warning in verses 18-19 is one every man, young or old, should take to heart: *“For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.”*
- This warning is also against *“the woman Folly.”* **Proverbs 9:13**
- Similar warnings are repeated throughout these first nine chapters.

**First Division – Chapters 3-4**

- **Proverbs 3-4** contain several long exhortations about the value of wisdom that begin *“My son…”* **Proverbs 3:1, 11, 21; 4:1, 10, 20**
- Chapter 4:10-27 is about *“the way of wisdom”* (**Proverbs 4:11**) and *“the path of the righteous.”* **Proverbs 4:18**
- These warnings and encouragement to live in obedience to teachings handed from parent to child include a wonderful warning: *“Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”* **Proverbs 4:23**
- Proverbs 4 ends with these beautiful, descriptive words: *“Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.”* **Proverbs 4:25-27**

**First Division – Chapters 5-7**

- **Proverbs 5** is another long poem of warning against *“the adulteress.”* **Proverbs 5:1-14**
- It includes a contrasting series of proverbs about the blessings found in a faithful marriage. **Proverbs 5:15-23**
- Concludes with another warning against the adulteress: *“For a man’s ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.”* **Proverbs 5:21**
- The theme of the high value of wisdom and the danger of folly continues.
- The final sixteen verses of Chapter 6 and all of Chapter 7 continue to warn against the adulteress.
- **Proverbs 7** is an especially graphic portrayal of seduction by a false woman and by false wisdom.

**First Division – Chapters 8-9**

- Wisdom is personified as being with God *“from the beginning”* (**Proverbs 8:23**), *“when he set the heavens in place.”* **Proverbs 8:27**
- This has been mistaken as a description of Jesus, but is better understood as his wisdom personified.
- Chapter 9 concludes with a final appeal from Wisdom and from *“the woman Folly.”* **Proverbs 9:13**
- Their appeals are similar, yet Wisdom offers life but those who choose Folly are told: *“Little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave.”* **Proverbs 9:18**

**Second and Largest Division – Chapters 10-25**

- These chapters are introduced as *“the proverbs of Solomon.”* **Proverbs 10:1**
- We get a sense that Solomon is putting, in the form of proverbs, the wise advice he received from his father David.
- He was not *“inventing”* wisdom, but is putting it in easily remembered short statements.
- Even though God gave great wisdom to Solomon, he made some very unwise choices.
- There was great hope that Solomon would be the son to fulfill the promises made to David, but he was not.
- One tragic point: for all of Solomon’s wisdom and wise advice, his only son, Rehoboam, was not wise.
- It is sad to note that Solomon said, *“A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son grief to his mother”* (**Proverbs 10:1**) and he had a foolish son.
- In **Proverbs 10-25** we have a collection of some 450 *“proverbial”* statements or observations about life by one who was given wisdom from God.
- Some are in theme groupings and some seem placed at random.
- A very important rule in considering the proverbs: they are not to be taken as promises, but as observations about life. Example: Although there are exceptions, *“Ill-gotten treasures are of no value, but righteousness delivers from death.”* (**Proverbs 10:2**) The basic truth of this statement is undeniable.

**Third Division – Chapters 25-29**

- The introduction says these chapters contain *“proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah.”* **Proverbs 25:1**
- Hezekiah reigned over 200 years after Solomon.
- The thought here is that as this good king sought to lead his people back to righteous living, Hezekiah authorized adding some of Solomon’s proverbs from an unknown collection to the existing book of Proverbs.

**Fourth and Fifth Divisions – Chapters 30-31**

- The authorship of these chapters is much in doubt.
- There have been many different suggestions as to the identities of *“Agur son of Jakeh”* (**Proverbs 30:1**) and *“King Lemuel”* (**Proverbs 31:1**)
**Review**

- Some agree these are later additions to the book and these authors are only known by their words here.
- The final chapter has a beautiful description of *a wife of noble character.* **Proverbs 31:10-31**
- This is a truthful tribute to a wonderful wife to which any godly woman should aspire.
- This section may also be taken as a conclusion to the entire book as the ultimate praise for Wisdom personified  
    - Wisdom has built her house; she has set up its seven pillars. She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table. She has sent out her servants, and she calls from the highest point of the city, *“Let all who are simple come to my house!”* To those who have no sense she says, *“Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of insight.”* **Proverbs 9:1-6**

**Review**

- **1 Kings 4:32** states that Solomon *“spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five.”*
- Although not all are recorded in Scripture, these memorably stated words of wisdom from the LORD, are as full of truth today as they were 3,000 years ago.
- The recommendation is for a regular (daily) diet of the wisdom of God from Proverbs.
- When we remember that in Christ *“are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,”* (**Colossians 2:3**), we will know him better through the wisdom he imparted to Solomon.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will examine the unique books of Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon. Both are attributed to Solomon.
- Ecclesiastes is written as a somber autobiography of one confined to the wisdom that is merely *“under the sun.”* **Ecclesiastes 1:1-3**
- The Song of Solomon is a love song and maybe a lot more.
