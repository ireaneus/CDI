**Review of the Previous Session**

- We looked specifically at some Messianic Psalms – songs that clearly point to the Messiah.
- We began with the songs that portray the sufferings of Jesus.
- Many poetic prayers in the Psalms speak of crying out to the LORD for help.
- The writer of Hebrews tells us, *“during the days of Jesus life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the One who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.”* **Hebrews 5:7**
- Because Jesus is, himself, the Word of God, these prayers of suffering in the Psalms belong to him as much as to those who wrote them.
- Remember Jesus’ words to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, *“How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”* **Luke 24:25-26**

**The Second Great Theme of the Messianic Psalms**

- The coming reign of the Anointed One.
- These were hymns of triumph.
- David had been promised a son whose throne would be established forever. The LORD said of this son, *“I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.”* **2 Samuel 7:14**
- This hope of an *“offspring”* was older than the promises to David. This ancient hope of people of faith was for the One who would *“crush”* the serpent (**Genesis 3:15**), and of One through whom *“all peoples of the earth would be blessed.”* **Genesis 12:3**

**Psalm 2 – The First of These Triumphant Songs**

- Psalm 2 is the first of the songs of the inevitable kingdom of the Son.
- No power on earth will stand against *“his Anointed One.”* **Psalm 2:2**
- *“The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, ‘I have installed my King on Zion, my holy mountain.’ I will proclaim the LORD’s decree: he said to me, ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’”* **Psalm 2:4-7**
- Referring to Jesus, **Psalm 2:9** is quoted in **Revelation 2:27 and 12:5**, *“You will rule [the nations] with an iron scepter; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”*
- Psalm 2 ends with a solemn warning: *“Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.”* **Psalm 2:11-12**

**Psalms Quoted in Hebrews 1**

- Hebrews 1 quotes from five different Psalms to prove that the Son, who was the Hope of Israel, is, in fact, God the Son.
- Hebrews 1:8 speaks of Jesus and says, *“Your throne, O God, will last forever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.”* **Psalm 45:6**
- Hebrews 1 recognizes that Jesus is the one who created heaven and earth.
- The writer tells us that Psalm 102:25-27 was talking about Jesus: *“In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.”* **Hebrews 1:10**
- This opening argument in Hebrews concludes with God saying to His glorious son, *“Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”* **Psalm 110:1; Hebrews 1:13**

**Psalm 8**

- Jesus came in the flesh and was *“made a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned with glory and honor.”* **Psalm 8:5**
- Quoted in **Hebrews 2:9-10** to illustrate Jesus’ humility in identifying with humanity so that he might bring *“many sons to glory.”*

**Psalm 24**

- This psalm declares the LORD’s rightful ownership of the earth.
- It asks and answers a difficult question: *“Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart.”* **Psalm 24:3-4**
- This is a call to holiness, and we all come up short.
- The second half of this Psalm shouts the wonderful answer, *“the King of glory”* is worthy! It is in his perfection, we too may enter.
- *“Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is he, this King of glory? The LORD Almighty — he is the King of glory.”* **Psalm 24:7-10**

**Psalm 45 – A Psalm of the Sons of Korah**

- It has an interesting inscription, *“A wedding song.”*
- It is the celebration of a noble groom (**Psalm 45:1-9**) and his bride. **Psalm 45:10-17**
- Of the groom it says:
    - *“You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed you forever.”* **Psalm 45:2**
    - This groom is called the *“mighty one”* (**Psalm 45:3**), clothed *“with splendor and majesty.”* **Psalm 45:4**
    - As in Hebrews 1, the Psalm says, *“Your throne, God, will last for ever and ever.”* **Psalm 45:6**
    - There is clearly a much higher theme than just a royal wedding.
- Of the bride:
    - Her description is equally exalted.
    - This is a prophetic picture of the intimate relationship between the LORD and Israel.
- The New Testament husband is to love his wife *“as Christ loved the church.”* **Ephesians 5:25**
- This connection between this wedding song and the wedding supper of the Lamb (**Revelation 19:9**) has been noted throughout the history of the church.
- In **Revelation 21:2**, John says, *“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.”*
- Psalm 45 is a joyful celebration of a glorious future union when **Revelation 21:3** is fulfilled: *“Now the dwelling of God is with men and He will live with them. They will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God."*

Psalm 118

- Here is another Psalm anticipating the coming of the King.
- In Psalm 118 are the words the crowds sang as Jesus entered Jerusalem the week before his death. *“This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it,”* **(Psalm 118:24)**, and they shouted, *“Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD!”* **Psalm 118:26**
- He had come not to save them from the Romans, but from their sins.
- The Psalm, rightly understood, tells of the coming King: *“The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone.”* **Psalm 118:22**
- Jesus prophesied when he wept over Jerusalem, *“You will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”* **Matthew 23:39**
- The theme of the triumph of the Messiah and the glories to be revealed is found frequently in the Psalms.

**Psalm 110**

- Jesus asked the Pharisees to explain this Psalm, but they refused.
- They correctly told him that the Christ (Messiah), would be *“the son of David.”* **Matthew 22:42**
- He then asked them the meaning of Psalm 110:1. He said: *“How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.”’ If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can He be his son?”* **Matthew 22:43-45**
- They could not answer because the clear truth was that the Messiah, whom the Scriptures said would be God’s Son, would have to be descended from David. Make no mistake, they knew who he was!
- Standing before them was the One whom Psalm 110:2 said, *“The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion; you will rule in the midst of your enemies.”*
- Jesus was he of whom this hymn sang, *“The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: ‘You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.’”* **Psalm 110:4**
- The one the Pharisees hated and would soon see crucified, is he who *“will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.”* **Psalm 110:6**

**Psalm 100**

- This is one of many songs of celebration not included with the Messianic Psalms.
- Like Psalm 47 and Psalm 95, Psalm 100 joyfully proclaims the King’s reign.
- When we understand that all Scripture is ultimately about Jesus, we will see him everywhere in the Psalms and wait in hope for His coming.

**Review**

- We have looked at the Messianic Psalms that spoke of the return of the King and His glorious reign.
- His coming to rule, foretold in the songs of the Hebrews, is irresistible.
- This coming King is the son of David as well as the Son of God.
- The wedding song of Psalm 45 is an intimate and joyful picture of the coming union of the Royal Son and his chosen Bride.
- Jesus used Psalm 110 to reveal the hardened hearts of the Pharisees.
- The mighty reign of the Son of David will come and those who resist will perish.
- Those *“who long for his appearing,”* (**2 Timothy 4:8**), will *“enter his gates with thanksgiving”* (**Psalm 100:4**) and *“everlasting joy will crown their heads.”* **Isaiah 35:10**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at the remaining books of Hebrew poetry in *“The Writings:”* *Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon*
- Job is much more than a discussion of suffering.
- Proverbs offers inspired truth about life as God sees it.
