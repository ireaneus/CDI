## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.66)*

You will KNOW:

- Mankind as a revelation of God from Genesis 1 and 2.
- The first five days of creation prepare for the crowning achievement of God's creative genius: Man, “made in His image.”

You will be ABLE TO:

- Discuss the unique importance of the animal kingdom and its relation to man as God commissions man to give names to the animals. Genesis 2

You will THINK ABOUT:

- What we can learn about God from the living creatures He made – His love of color and variety and even a sense of *“personality”* that living things possess.
- The creation of man and woman in God's *“image and…likeness.”* Genesis 1:26

**Begin video.**

**Review of Previous Session**

- See in the week of creation, a revelation of God himself, just as an artist may be recognized by his work.
- In Romans 1:20, Paul says, *“God's invisible qualities – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.”*
- Light, air, water, continents, plants and animals, the sun, moon and stars – all of creation helps us to know about God.
- Even greater is the revelation of Himself in creatures made in his own image and likeness.

The Physical Nature of God

- Not encouraged from Scripture to think of God's physical nature.
- Early in Genesis 1 when we read of God speaking and his Spirit *“hovering”*, we have no idea of His form.
- **Genesis 1:26** provides a clue to His *"nature” “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness that they may rule…”*
- We are allowed to think of God as a “plurality,” as more than one.
- Remember *“Elohim”* is a plural noun and now God says, *“Let Us make man in Our image”* (emphasis added). This shows an *“inter-personal”* nature about God.
- This is not just *“God speaking majestically,”* but is a revelation about Himself.
- Further into Scripture, we will see God appearing in a physical form and speaking and we’ll see His Spirit moving in people's lives.
- God will tell us of Himself.

Created in His Image and His Likeness

- He is a relational being and, as such, is personal, having a mind, a will and emotions.
- The repeated statement, *“And God saw that it was good,”* tells that He has feelings about what He has made.
- He created man in His own image and likeness having these same attributes.
- Man was created as a relational being to think, decide and feel.
- God's interactions with the man and woman were relational and He commanded them to *“be fruitful and increase in number,”* **(Genesis 1:28)** and have dominion over the earth and its creatures.

**The Sixth Day**

- Genesis 1 gives a condensed version of the sixth day.
- God created *“male and female”* and then His creative acts were completed.
- The Creator chose to make beings that are in many ways *“like”* him; who would interact with Him. This is His desire and our purpose.
- Although we are made in His image, He is superior and we owe him our existence and our obedience.
- *“God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning – the sixth day.”* **Genesis 1:31**
- The Creation story includes the first four verses of Genesis chapter 2.
- With His work of creation finished, He *“rested from all the work of creating He had done.”* **Genesis 2:3**
- His resting is a theme that will be significant throughout Scripture.

**Looking Closer at the Creation of the Man and the Woman**

- Genesis 2 is an expanded, closer look at the events of the sixth day.
- Creation of man in His own image and likeness is the pinnacle of God's creative excellence.
- **Genesis 2:4-7, 18-23** provides an intimate look at the forming of man and woman.
- Genesis 2:5 seems contradictory to Genesis 1:11-13, but Genesis 2:8 informs us that the LORD God *“had planted a garden in the east, in Eden.”* – a garden already in place before the man was put there.
- Genesis 2:7 tells us *“the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.”*
- God formed the man knowing that He, God, would Himself take on this form for our salvation.
- Man was formed outside the garden and then placed in it.
- Verses 9-14 tell about the garden.

**Man Given Responsibilities**

- In Genesis 2:15, man was given responsibility even before the curse of sin.
- Therefore, work is a blessing and a privilege.
- Genesis 2:16-17 contain the command, *“You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.”*
- Here we see the Creator's sense of right and wrong, the necessity of learning to obey and the significance of consequences.

**Remaining Events of the Sixth Day**

- The LORD God brought the animals to the man for naming, which speaks of man's immediate intelligence, verbal skills, insight and his uniqueness.
- Unlike the animals, man had no mate.
- In Genesis 2:18 God stated, *“It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”*
- Man formed from dust and the woman from the man is an important theme throughout Scripture.
- Bearing God's image and likeness is an immense privilege.
- Confusion comes when mankind denies his unique position as image bearer and caretaker.
- We see the foundation of God's great concern for mankind – so great that He Himself would become like us to rescue us from our rebellion.

**Review of This Session**

- Mankind is unique among all of God's works and bears the image of the Creator.
- God's great love for us and His unfailing purpose in redemption caused Him to rescue us with His own life.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- The days of creation.
- Timeframe in which creation occurred.
- The meaning of Scripture is the best way to discover the nature of our world.
