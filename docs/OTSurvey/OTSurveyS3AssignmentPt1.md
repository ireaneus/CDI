**Review of Previous Session**

- Looked at the different divisions of the Hebrew Scriptures
- Memorized the books of the Old Testament in the standard order in the LXX and the order given in the Tanakh.

**The First Sentence in the Bible**

- *“God, created, in the beginning, the, heaven, and, the earth.”* - **The Hebrew Order**
- The seven Hebrew words of **Genesis 1:1** are called the *“perfect sentence”* or *“the most perfect sentence that has ever been written.”*
- **The first word**, *“Elohim,”* is plural – the *“im”* is similar to the “s” in English. The first hint that God exists as *“more than singular”*
- The linguistic principle is that the verb determines proper translation of the noun.
- In Genesis 1:1, *“Elohim”* is plural, but the verb *“created”* is singular, so correct translation is *“God created”* not *“Gods created.”*
- This is a revelation of the triune nature of Almighty God

**“In the Beginning” Elsewhere in Scripture**

- In **John 1:1-3** where the Apostle John uses this phrase to identify Jesus, the Word,as the Creator: *“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him. Without Him was not anything made that has been made.”*
- In **1 John 1:1-2**, John writes concerning Jesus, the Word: *“That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life. The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.”*

**New Testament Reference to Jesus as “Creator”**

- In **Colossians 1:15-17**, Paul writes to convince readers of the supremacy of Christ: *“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created, in the heavens and on earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through Him, and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things are held together.”*
- Throughout Scripture the phrase, *“the Maker of heaven and earth”* is often repeated, as in **Psalm 121:2**. We also see: *“the LORD made the heavens and the earth.”* **Exodus 20:11**
- John recognized Jesus as *“The Word,”* because of statements like, *“By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of His mouth. He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; He puts the deeps in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere Him. For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.”* **Psalm 33:6-9**
- The many references to the mighty acts of the Creator throughout the Hebrew Scriptures are speaking of the pre-incarnate Christ.

The Triune God Working as One

- No member of the Godhead acts independently of any other member.
- **Genesis 1:2**: *“...and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.”*
- **John 1:3** shows the Son of God as Creator: *“Through Him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.”*
- **Hebrews 1:2** recognizes the Father working through Jesus in creation: *“...His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and the through whom He made the universe.”*
- When we read in the Bible of the Creator – we must see our Lord Jesus Christ: *“O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures. Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great.”* **Psalm 104:24-25**

**Review**

- The seven words of the opening sentence in the Bible as the *“perfect sentence.”* 7 being the number for whole or 100%.
- *“Elohim,”* a plural noun, gives a hint about the *“more than singular”* nature of God.
- The verb *“created”* is singular and determines the correct translation of the noun, so *“Elohim”* must be translated as singular.
- Through the first three verses in Genesis, God reveals unique things about Himself.
- The second verse introduces *“the Spirit of God.”*
- In verse three, we hear of the power of God's word as he speaks things into existence.
- From the Bible's first verse, we are led to see the Messiah, Jesus, the Maker of Heaven and Earth.
