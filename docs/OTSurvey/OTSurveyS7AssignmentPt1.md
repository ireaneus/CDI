**Begin video.**

**Review**

- The Nevim consists of 8 books: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Twelve.
- Joshua is never called a prophet.
- The record of his leadership begins under Moses but is clearly not part of the books of Moses.

**Preview**

- The book of Joshua describes the transition into the Promised Land.
- God’s prophetic messengers begin to appear following Joshua’s death.

**Joshua – A Man Uniquely Set Apart by God**

- Deuteronomy ended with Moses’ death and the passing of the leadership of Israel to Joshua. *“Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the  Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.”* **Deuteronomy 34:9**
- Joshua’s name is the Hebrew equivalent of Jesus. Keep this in mind as we learn about this man, chosen to lead His people into the Promised Land.
- We are first introduced to Joshua in Exodus 17.
- As the Israelites traveled from Egypt to Mt. Sinai, they were attacked by the Amalekites.
- **Numbers 11:28** says that Joshua *“had been Moses’ aide since youth.”* Apparently he had already come to Moses’ attention as a leader, so Moses instructs him to, *“Choose some of our men and go out to fight.”* **Exodus 17:9**
- This is Joshua’s first recorded attempt at war and his success is dependent on the intercession of Moses, Aaron and Hur.
- In Exodus 24, Joshua is the only one to go with Moses up Mt. Sinai to receive the stone tablets with God’s Law written on them. When they come back down the mountain and hear the revelry of the people worshiping Aaron’s golden calf, Joshua mistakes the sound for another attack against the people.
- In Exodus 33, is one of the most interesting early glimpses of Joshua. Moses would meet with the LORD in a special *“tent of meeting”* outside the camp. In verse 11 we are told that the LORD would speak to Moses *“face-to-face, as a man speaks with his friend.”* Then Moses would return to the camp, *“but his young aide, Joshua son of Nun, did not leave the tent.”*
- We are not told any more than this, but we begin to picture a young man being uniquely set apart by God.
- Numbers 13-14 tell that Joshua is chosen as one of the twelve *“spies,”* representing the tribe of Ephraim to explore the land.
- Joshua and Caleb, of the tribe of Judah, bring back an honest and faithful report – believing that God can bring them success.
- The other ten spies are fearful and *“spread…a bad report about the land.”* **Numbers 13:32**
- As a result of their unbelief, that generation is condemned to wander in the wilderness for 40 years until they all die.
- Only Joshua and Caleb live to bring the next generation into the Land.
- **Psalm 95 and Hebrews 3-4** use this story to teach about entering the spiritual *“rest”* that is promised to those who have faith in Jesus.

**Moses Passes the Leadership of Israel to Joshua**

- At the end of the book of Numbers, near the end of the 40 years in the wilderness, the LORD instructs Moses to publicly commission Joshua to lead Israel. **Numbers 27:18-23; Deuteronomy 3:28; 31:7-8, 14**
- Joshua may not have been a bold leader. This is not surprising in light of the great responsibilities placed on him.
- In **Deuteronomy 31:7**, Moses tells him to be “strong and courageous”, and the LORD repeats this to him **31:23** and several times in **Joshua 1:6-7, 9.**
- In **Joshua 1:9**, the LORD says, *“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.”*
    - This verse has brought great encouragement to many who have felt unequal to the tasks of spiritual leadership.
- **Joshua 1:8** is a verse you will need to memorize. This is God’s word of encouragement to Joshua and to all of us who would be faithful to the Scriptures. *“Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.”* **Joshua 1:8**

**The Book of Joshua Chapters 1-11**

- The first 11 chapters of Joshua describe, fairly quickly, the Israelites entry into the Promised Land telling of both great victories and tragic set-backs.
- Much of the rest of the book covers the process of dividing the land amongst the 9½ tribes that chose to live there.
- As the book opens, the LORD commands Joshua to get the people ready to cross the Jordan River and begin to possess the land.
- Sending out two *“spies”* to look over the land, doesn’t seem like a good idea in light of what had happened 40 years earlier.
- However, a fascinating result is that a prostitute named *Rahab*, by faith, will aid the spies, marry into the tribe of Judah and become a great, great, great… grandmother of *Jesus*. **Matthew 1:5**
- There is something about Jesus on every page of Scripture!
- The Israelites miraculously cross the Jordan River *“on dry ground”* **(Joshua 3:17)**, just as they had crossed the Red Sea.
- Memorial stones taken from the riverbed are set up to remind future generations *“that the hand of the LORD is powerful” and “so that you might always fear the LORD your God.”* **Joshua 4:24**

**Preparing to Take Jericho**

- As the Israelites camp *“on the plains of Jericho”* **(Joshua 5:10)**, the LORD instructs Joshua to circumcise this second generation of those who had escaped Egypt.
- This seem to be a bad strategy: to disable your army in enemy territory.
- The Israelites celebrate the Passover and then the LORD appears to Joshua.
- Joshua sees *“a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword,”* and asks him, *“Are you for us or for our enemies?”* The LORD’s answer is, *“Neither, but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come… Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.”* **Joshua 5:13-15**
    - That this is the LORD is made clear in the next verses where we read, *“Then the LORD said to Joshua…”* **Joshua 6:2**
    - This is another *“Theophany,”* an Old Testament appearance of Jesus.
    - Jesus must be recognized as *“The commander of the army of the LORD.”* **Joshua 5:15**
    - This answer to Joshua should cause us to pause and wonder if we are on the LORD’s side, not if He is on ours.
    - Jesus our Savior is a mighty warrior **(Psalm 24:8)**, and *“mighty to save.”* **Zephaniah 3:17**
    - What a wonder it was when *“a vast, heavenly army”* shouted *“Glory to God!”* **(Luke 2:13-14 NET)**, over the plains of Bethlehem as their Commander-in-Chief was humbly born!

**Taking the Promised Land – Successes and Failures**

- The LORD had a unique and successful battle plan for conquering Jericho.
- Archeology has verified the complete destruction of this city in the time of Joshua. (I recommend the video, Patterns of Evidence, by Tim Mahoney. In this video, the evidence is given of the truth about the fall of Jericho.)
- Victory at Jericho and Rahab‘s rescue are great testimonies of God’s power and grace.
- Achan’s sin of greed and disobedience is recorded in chapter 7. The consequences of his sin are a sober reminder that our God is not to be trifled with and that the sin of one person may affect many others.
- After the sin is dealt with in the camp and they successfully conquer Ai, they stumble again.
    - The story of their being tricked by the Gibeonites is summed up in one sentence: *“The men of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not inquire of the LORD.”* **Joshua 9:14**
    - This failure will have far-reaching consequences **(see 2 Samuel 21)**, but it immediately led to a miraculous victory.
    - Because Gibeon, as a significant Canaanite city, has made peace with Israel, the kings of the southern cities unite to destroy them.
    - Chapter 10 records the defeat of these kings. God actually stopped *“the sun in the middle of the sky”* **(Joshua 10:13)**, so the Israelites could defeat all these armies in a single, long day. *“There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!”* **Joshua 10:14**
- A second military campaign destroys their enemies in the northern part of the land.

**Dividing the Land**

- Next it is time to divide the land amongst the tribes of Israel.
- Important aspect of this division is the setting apart of *“cities of refuge”* **(Joshua 20)**, for those who may kill someone accidentally.
- These cities are provided for in the Law: Numbers 35, Deuteronomy 4 and 19.
- These *“cities of refuge”* would become places where a person’s guilt or innocence could be determined before the priests.
- These also spoke of the grace of God and pointed to Jesus, our true spiritual refuge.
- The tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh return to the east side of the Jordan as agreed upon in Numbers 32, carried out in Joshua 22.
    - That these tribes chose not to live in the Promised Land will impact Israel’s history for hundreds of years.
    - Throughout history, many have professed faith, but have been satisfied to live outside the promises of God and the *“promised rest”* he offers.

**Joshua’s Farewell Speech**

- Recorded in Joshua 23 and 24.
- Here is the final message of this man whose name, Joshua, speaks of a greater Commander of the Armies of the LORD.
- As Joshua challenged his people, Jesus also calls us to *“choose this day whom you will serve”* **Josh 24:15**.
    - Our Savior won the victory over sin and death by his death and resurrection and invites us into the household of faith, the *“family of believers.”* **Galatians 6:10**
    - May we also take our stand with our Greater Joshua and choose to serve the LORD. **Josh 24:15**

**Review**

- Joshua’s early years as Moses’ aide.
- How God set him apart to become Israel’s leader.
- That, though he may not have been naturally bold, he trusted the LORD and was used by God to bring his people into the Promised Land.
- Though there were times of failure under his leadership, Joshua persevered to the end of his life and left a legacy and a challenge to all those God has called to serve the LORD.
- Joshua is an important Old Testament type of Christ as the one who foreshadowed what Jesus would fulfill in leading those who trust him, into the *“Sabbath-rest for the people of God.”* **Hebrews 4:9**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- The book of Judges.
- We will see a downward spiral of sin, slavery, repentance and deliverance as *“every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”* **Judges 21:25**
- We will see the Judges as types, and sometimes, antithetical types of Jesus
