**Begin video.**

**In the Previous Session**

- Overview of the book of Isaiah.
- We saw in this majestic collection of Isaiah’s writings some of the clearest glimpses of One who would one day sit on David’s throne.
- With his eyes on God’s dealings with his own wayward nation, he saw on the prophetic horizon One whose kingdom would never end.
- He saw glimpses of a Servant who would suffer greatly yet conquer.
- He also saw glimpses of a new heaven and a new earth.

**Historical Background**

- Isaiah ministered in Jerusalem at the time of the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC.
- The Assyrians conquered Israel and took captive the 10 northern tribes.
- Their intent was to do the same to Judah.
- God destroyed the Assyrian army and rescued Jerusalem in answer to the prayers of Hezekiah and Isaiah.
- It was at this time that Hezekiah was healed and given 15 more years of life.
- Hezekiah’s son, Manasseh, became king at age 12 and did not have the faith of his father.
- Manasseh’s wickedness would contribute to the disastrous moral decline of Judah.
- God allowed 100 years of peace in Judah. During that time, Assyria was destroyed by a confederation of northern powers – Media, Persia and Babylon.

**The Beginnings of Jeremiah’s Ministry**

- Jeremiah was called to minister around 627 BC in the 13th year of the reign of the godly King Josiah, the grandson of Manasseh. **Jeremiah 1:2**
- Jerusalem lasted 40 more years.
- God’s commission to Jeremiah in chapter 1:4–19 reveals much of what lay in store for him.
- He knew he was unequal to the task, so the Lord tells him, *“Do not be afraid.”* **Jeremiah 1:8**
- God touches Jeremiah’s mouth and says, *“Now, I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.”* **Jeremiah 1:9–10**
- His first visions prepared him for his coming ministry.
- The vision of the almond tree, which in Hebrew sounds like the word *“watching,”* spoke of God’s deep concern for his people and for Jeremiah.
- The vision of *“a boiling pot, tilting away from the north,”* **Jeremiah 1:13**, is like an ominous cloud of judgment forming in the powerful nations gathering around Babylon.
- From the beginning, the LORD’s words put in Jeremiah’s mouth carry notes of anguished warning.
- His first message is:
    - *“Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols… My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.”* **Jeremiah 2:11–13**
    - His lament continues:
    - *“Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding garments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.”* **Jeremiah 2:32**
- In Chapter 8, the LORD says:
    - *“When people fall down, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not return? Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away?”* **Jeremiah 8:4–5**

**Jeremiah – Known as “The Weeping Prophet”**

- He embodies God’s sorrow for his wayward people.
- He cries out:
    - *“Oh that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people.”* **Jeremiah 9:1**
- Several times in his long and unpopular ministry he feared for his life.
- In Chapter 11, the LORD revealed a plot against his life.
- In Chapter 12, the LORD responds to Jeremiah’s complaint:
    - *“If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses?”* **Jeremiah 12:5–6**
- In Chapters 18–19, Jeremiah is told to go to the potter’s house.
- Rather than heed the warning, the priest Pashhur has Jeremiah beaten and put in stocks.
- Upon his release, Jeremiah declares:
    - *“Terror on every side!”* **Jeremiah 20:3**

**Jeremiah Is a Compilation of Messages**

- Not strictly chronological.
- This is evident in Chapter 21 where King Zedekiah is mentioned and then, later, in Chapter 36, the earlier King, Jehoiakim, is on the throne.

**Turning Point in Jeremiah’s Ministry – Chapter 25**

- For 23 years Jeremiah has called the people and kings in Jerusalem to repentance, *“but,”* he says to them *“you have not listened.”* **Jeremiah 25:3**
- In this prophetic message he declares that God’s judgment has come. The LORD declares, *“I will summon...the king of Babylon”* and *“This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.”* **Jeremiah 25:9, 11**
- The first part of this prophecy begins to be fulfilled immediately. Its ultimate fulfillment is still ahead.

**The Final Four Kings of Judah**

- 2 Chronicles relates the rapid succession of these *kings: Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah*.
- Jeremiah was there with them warning and pleading the entire time.
- Jehoiakim was the most notorious. When he was given a written copy of Jeremiah’s inspired warnings he threw them in the fire. **Jeremiah 36**
- Nebuchadnezzar *“bound him [Jehoiakim] with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.”* **2 Chronicles 36:6**
- His son, Jehoiachin, reigned only 3 months before he was brought to Babylon.
- Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah king – the last king. **2 Chronicles 36:10**

**One of Jeremiah’s Best Known Messages**

- Sent to the Jews who had been taken captive to Babylon when Jehoiakim reigned – *Daniel* among them.
- To confirm that their captivity would last 70 years he wrote that they should, *“build houses and settle down.”* Then *“when 70 years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you...to bring you back.”* **Jeremiah 29:5, 10**
- Then came the wonderful promise, *“‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.’”* **Jeremiah 29:11**

**Struggle Between Weak King Zedekiah and Bold Prophet Jeremiah**

- In Chapters 28–39, twice Jeremiah is thrown into a muddy dungeon and twice he is rescued.
- He challenges Zedekiah to obey and trust the LORD. **Jeremiah 37–38**
- In the middle of this struggle, comes one of the greatest promises in the Old Testament. Here the LORD declares that there is hope; greater hope than had been imagined.
    - *“The days are coming,”* declares the LORD, *“when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,”* declares the LORD. *“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,”* declares the LORD. *“I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,”* declares the LORD. *“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”* **Jeremiah 31:31–34**
- In the shadow of approaching destruction, comes promise of greater hope.
- In the reign of Jerusalem’s last king, comes the promise of a new and different agreement, a covenant with a promise of a law written on hearts and sins forgiven and forgotten.
- Six-hundred years later, the true King of the Jews said on the night before he was crucified, *“This cup is the new covenant in my blood.”* **Luke 22:20** Jeremiah’s words were fulfilled.
- Although the weeping prophet had much more to suffer, the seed of hope had been planted.

**Final Stroke for Zedekiah and Jerusalem**

- In Zedekiah’s eleventh year, after an 18-month siege, Jerusalem fell.
- Last thing Zedekiah sees, before he is blinded, is the execution of his sons and noblemen.
- *“The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace...and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.”* **Jeremiah 39:8**
- Jeremiah is captured and then freed to return to the straggling survivors who had been left behind.
- Even these few survivors, who have seen the prophet’s warnings fulfilled, turn deaf ears to the word of the LORD and flee to Egypt. **Jeremiah 41–43**
- In Egypt, the LORD continues to speak through Jeremiah.
- Chapter 44 is a message to those who fled there from the power of Babylon.
- They are told that, because of their continued disobedience, they will not escape judgment even in Egypt. The LORD says, through Jeremiah, *“I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish...until they are destroyed.”* **Jeremiah 44:27**

**Jeremiah’s Final Prophecies**

- Against the nations surrounding Jerusalem.
- **Jeremiah 46** – the destruction of Egypt.
- **Jeremiah 47** – the destruction of the Philistines.
- **Jeremiah 48** – Moab‘s overthrow.
- **Jeremiah 49** – the LORD’s judgment against Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Hamor and Elam.
- **Jeremiah 50–51** – the fall of mighty Babylon.
- The nation that destroyed Jerusalem will come under the full wrath of God. The Apostle John, will echo Jeremiah’s words in **Revelation 17–18**.
- **Jeremiah 52** – retelling of Jerusalem’s fall.

**Brief review of Jeremiah’s Ministry**

- In the midst of the destruction of his nation and his own personal suffering, Jeremiah faithfully proclaimed the word of the LORD for 50 years.
- Jesus has been present with him since before he was born. Jeremiah said, at his call to ministry, *“the word of the LORD came to me saying, ‘before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.’”* **Jeremiah 1:4–5**
- As Jeremiah wept over unfaithful Jerusalem, Jesus too would weep. **Matthew 23:37–38; Luke 19:41–44**
- As Jeremiah, surrounded by hopelessness, had proclaimed hope, Jesus would be the fulfillment of all hope.
- The LORD, the Living Word, spoke through the unheeded prophet, Jeremiah, of a new covenant.
- Jesus is the fulfillment of that new covenant.
- *“The Spirit of Christ”* (**1 Peter 1:11**), was in Jeremiah, pointing forward to a greater prophet, a faithful priest and a righteous King.
- Through Jeremiah’s ministry was added the promise of a better covenant.

**Lamentations**

- A collection of five poems by Jeremiah recalling the recent destruction of Jerusalem.
- The first four poems are acrostics based on the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The final poem has 22 verses but is not an acrostic.
- In the middle of the third poem, comes the great cry of hope, *“Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: Because of the LORD’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.”* **Lamentations 3:21-23**

**Review**

- A brief scan of the longest Old Testament book covering the darkest time in the
Jews ancient history. Yet even there, hope lay ahead.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- Look at the ministry of Ezekiel, the prophet in exile, the other *“Son of man.”* **Ezekiel 2:1**

## Key Observations

- **Isaiah precedes** Jeremiah but **overlaps historically** in the late Assyrian / early Babylonian transition.
- **Jeremiah and Ezekiel are true contemporaries**, one in Jerusalem, one in exile.
- **Daniel overlaps with both**, serving in Babylon while Jeremiah writes to exiles.
- All four prophets:
    - Proclaim **judgment**
    - Affirm **God’s sovereignty**
    - Anchor hope in a **future, righteous Kingdom**
- Their messages **do not contradict**, but **layer progressively**, pointing forward to Christ.

## Key Historical Anchors

- **605 BC** – Battle of Carchemish (Egypt defeated)
- **597 BC** – First major exile (Jehoiachin)
- **586 BC** – Jerusalem destroyed
- **582 BC** – Babylon campaigns against surrounding nations
- **539 BC** – Fall of Babylon
- **538 BC** – Decree of Cyrus (return begins)

## Theological Observation

- Jeremiah’s prophecies **progress outward**:
    - Judah → surrounding nations → Babylon
- Babylon, the instrument of judgment, **does not escape judgment**

    - **Hope beyond exile**
    - **A future covenant**
    - **God’s sovereignty over all nations**
