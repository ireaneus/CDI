## CDI Notes

**Instructor’s Guide** *(pp. 205–210)*

You will KNOW:

- When, where and to whom did Isaiah minister?

You will be ABLE TO:

- Identify passages that explain why the book of Isaiah is called *“The Gospel According to Isaiah”* or *“The Gospel in the Old Testament.”*

- How Isaiah’s messages in Chapter 5 relate to Jesus’ messages in **Matthew 21** and **23.**

**Begin video.**

**Review of The Previous Session**

- Jesus the King.
- Covered the reigns of David, his son Solomon and the reign of the kings in the divided kingdom.
- Historical records found in **2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings and 1-2 Chronicles**.
- Period of time covered is approximately from 1,000 BC to 500 BC.
- Northern Kingdom of Israel destroyed and the people scattered in 722 BC.
- Jerusalem overrun and its people taken captive to Babylon in 586 BC where they remain for 70 years.

**About Isaiah, the Man**

- Began his prophetic ministry in Jerusalem at the end of the reign of King Uzziah – around 740 BC.
- Spoke the Word of the LORD to the kings and inhabitants of Jerusalem during the overthrow of Israel and the near destruction of Judah by the Assyrians.
- Ministered during the reigns of *Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah and Manasseh*.

**About the Book of Isaiah**

- Called *“The Gospel according to Isaiah”* or *“The Gospel in the Old Testament.”*
- No other book in Hebrew Scripture has so much to say about the person and work of the coming Anointed One.
- Authors of the New Testament quote Isaiah more than any other Old Testament book.
- Third longest Old Testament book.
- Two main divisions: First 39 chapters and the last 27 chapters
- Interestingly, this corresponds to the fact that there are 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament.
- Chapters 1-39 are embedded in a context of political turmoil as the nation of Assyria to the north advances and eventually destroys Israel, overruns Judah and surrounds Jerusalem.
- Most of Isaiah’s prophecies in these chapters are written in the form of Hebrew poetry.
- Isaiah 36-39 recount the climax of the Assyrian advance. Their armies are destroyed by the Angel of the LORD in answer to King Hezekiah’s prayers, and Isaiah’s prophecy.
- Last 27 chapters are Isaiah’s final 27 messages to the people of Jerusalem after they are delivered from Assyria.

**The Opening Five Chapters of Isaiah**

- A preamble to his collected messages.
- Set the tone for the first division of the book.
- In the first chapter is a powerful denunciation of Judah’s sins and a call to repentance.
- Introductory verse sets the time frame for Isaiah’s ministry.
- His message begins,
    - *Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth!  For the LORD has spoken: “I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.  The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.”  Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption!  They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.* **Isaiah 1:2-4**
- Later comes a well-known plea:
    - *“Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.”  For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.* **Isaiah 1:18-20**
- Chapter 5 begins with a song about a vineyard. Jesus refers to this text in **Matthew 21**, in his parable about the wicked tenants.
- The last part of Isaiah 5 concludes with six *“Woes”* pronounced against the sins of Jerusalem.  The LORD’s message here foreshadows Jesus seven *“Woes”* against the Scribes and Pharisees in **Matthew 23**.

**Isaiah 6**

- Describes the prophet’s call and the beginning of his prophetic service.
- Isaiah is called *“In the year that King Uzziah died.”* **Isaiah 6:1**
- In his first encounter with the LORD he sees *“the LORD seated on a throne, high and exalted.”* **Isaiah 6:1**
- He is overwhelmed and cries out, *“Woe to me! I am ruined!  For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty!”* **Isaiah 6:5**
- Here, God commissions Isaiah to go to people who will not listen.
- Jesus refers to Isaiah’s call when he explains why he speaks in parables.  Jesus also will speak to people whose hearts *“have become calloused,”* who *“hardly hear with their ears”* and who *“have closed their eyes.”* **Matthew 13:15**

**Isaiah 7, 8, and 9**

- Context involves the fears of King Ahaz, grandson of Uzziah, and the promise of a son.
- A powerful confederacy between the nation of Syria and the Kingdom of Israel threatens to destroy Judah.
- Isaiah’s message to ungodly King Ahaz is, *“Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid.  Do not lose heart.”* **Isaiah 7:4**
- He tells Ahaz that God will destroy these nations and says, *“If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.”* **Isaiah 7:9**
- As a sign to Ahaz, comes the great prophecy, *“the LORD himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.”* **Isaiah 7:14**
- This theme continues and reaches its pinnacle in Chapter 9:
    - *For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.  And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign on David’s throne…forever.* **Isaiah 9:6-7**

**Historical Setting of the First Part of Isaiah**

- Slow, irresistible advance of mighty Assyria from the north.
- They destroy Damascus, capital of Syria during the latter part of Ahaz’ reign.
- Thinking to outwit the confederacy of Israel and Syria, Ahaz appeals to the king of Assyria for help.
- But, *“Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria came to him, but gave him trouble instead of help.”* **2 Chronicles 28:20**
- Ahaz desires to appease this mighty king and disregards all of Isaiah’s warnings and nearly brings about the destruction of the nation of Judah.

**Isaiah 10-35**

- These chapters concern the nations surrounding Judah and the impossibility of looking to them for help.
- The judgments of God will fall on:
    - Assyria, **Isaiah 10:5-19; 14:24-28**
    - The Philistines, **Isaiah 14:28-32**
    - Moab, **Isaiah 15-16**
    - Damascus, **Isaiah 17**
    - Cush and Egypt, **Isaiah 18-20**
    - Babylon, **Isaiah 13-14 & 21**
    - Tyre, **Isaiah 23**
    - Ephraim, **Isaiah 28**
    - All the nations of the earth, **Isaiah 24, 34**
- Woven throughout are words of warning and hope for Jerusalem.
- Repeatedly, Jerusalem is warned against looking to Egypt for help.  **Isaiah 19; 30-31**
- Hope is given when Isaiah 11-12 speak of a *“Branch”* from *“the stump of Jesse”* (David’s father), and that *“The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him.”* **Isaiah 11:1-2**
- Isaiah 25-27 offer great words of hope and promise.  A favorite of the instructor is from Chapter 25 where the LORD says, *“On this mountain the LORD…will swallow up death forever.”* **Isaiah 25:6-8**
- Messages conclude in Chapter 35 with a brief glimpse of Heaven itself: *“The redeemed of the LORD will return.  They will enter Zion with singing and everlasting joy will crown their heads.”* **Isaiah 35:10**

**Isaiah 36-39**

- An historical account of the near disaster when Assyria surrounds Jerusalem.  These events are also recorded in **2 Kings and 2 Chronicles**.
- Faithful King Hezekiah seeks Isaiah’s intercession and cries out to the LORD for help and God miraculously delivers Jerusalem.
- Sadly, King Hezekiah again demonstrates the weakness of an earthly king.
- God delivers him from a deadly illness and grants him 15 more years of life, but Hezekiah becomes proud (**2 Chronicles 32:25**), and though he repents, there will be consequences, the worst of which is the birth of his son, Manasseh, who will lead Jerusalem into the most horrible of sins.

**The Last 27 Messages of Isaiah**

- Given in the final 15 years of Hezekiah’s reign.
- They begin with one of the most powerful passages in all of Scripture, Isaiah 40.  This message is to a nation so recently delivered from disaster and begins *“Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.”* **Isaiah 40:1**
- Keil and Delitzsch Old Testament commentary lists these 27 messages, although not exactly in agreement with the numbered chapters and verses, the *“arrangement of this cycle of prophecies has hardly been disputed by anyone.”*
    - (Keil & Delitzsch, Commentary on the Old Testament, Vol. 5 – Psalms, p. 69, published by Wm. B. Eerdmans, reprinted 1973.)
- They point out that these chapters are a series of 3 groups of 9 messages, with each group centered on a specific characteristic of the Servant of the LORD.

**Isaiah 40-48 – the Coming of the *“Servant”* of the LORD**

- This *“servant”* of the LORD, *“will bring justice to the nations.”* **Isaiah 42:1**
- *“He will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth.”* **Isaiah 42:4**
- He will *“open eyes that are blind,”* and *“free captives from prison.”* **Isaiah 42:7**
- These prophecies are clearly meant to be fulfilled in Jesus, however, they are also prophetic of Cyrus, King of Persia.
- Cyrus will not even be born for another 150 years, but Isaiah, by the Spirit says, *“This is what the LORD says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of…though you do not acknowledge me.”* **Isaiah 45:1-4**
- Cyrus will be the ruler to release the Jews from captivity in Babylon and commission them to return and rebuild the Temple.  **2 Chronicles 36:22-23**

**Isaiah 49-57 – A Suffering Servant**

- These are the middle 9 messages which speak of a suffering servant who says:
    - *“See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.”* **Isaiah 49:16**
    - *“I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard.”* **Isaiah 50:6**
- The mid-point of these 9 chapters and of Isaiah’s final 27 messages is Chapter 53.
- This message begins in **Isaiah 52:12** and also has three parts, which also describe the themes of each of these final groups of messages:
    - The appearance of the servant.  **Isaiah 52:12-53:3**
    - His suffering.  **Isaiah 53:4-9**
    - His victory.  **Isaiah 53:10-12**
- Chapters 40-48 – speak of the coming of the servant.
- Chapters 49-57 – reach their climax with his suffering.
- Chapters 58-66 – the servant’s eventual victory.

**Isaiah 58-66 – The Servant’s Victory**

- There are common themes in all of these 9 messages.
- As Isaiah’s ministry draws to a close, the expectation of the eternal reign of God’s chosen servant grows stronger.
- The aged prophet sees *“new heavens and a new earth”* where *“the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard no more.”* **Isaiah 65:17, 19**
- The prophet, through some 50 years of ministry, saw glimpses of a coming son and a Prince of Peace.
- He also told of a suffering, righteous servant who *“will justify many”* and who *“will bear their iniquities.”* **Isaiah 53:11**
- Peter would say over 600 years later: *“the Spirit of Christ”* was pointing, through Isaiah, to Jesus, *“when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.”* **1 Peter 1:11**

**Review**

- A quick overview of the great book of Isaiah.
- Two major parts of this book divided by the crisis of the near destruction of Jerusalem.
- In Isaiah’s final messages, he tells of a future servant who will suffer and be victorious.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- Look at another great prophet of Israel who would suffer through the destruction of his nation.
- Jeremiah is known as *“the weeping prophet.”*  He brings a message of great hope.

**Assignment: Discuss Key Points**

- Be prepared to discuss the KNOW, ARE ABLE TO and WILL BE THINKING ABOUT statements from this session that appear at the beginning of this session in your guidebook.

**Read Isaiah Chapter 5 and Matthew Chapters 21 and 23**

You will THINK ABOUT:

- How Isaiah’s messages in Chapter 5 relate to Jesus’ messages in Matthew 21 and Matthew 23.

## Isaiah Chapter 5

**Isaiah 5:1-7 - Parable of the Vineyard**

> 1. *"Let me sing now for my well-beloved A song of my beloved concerning His vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.*
> 2. *"He dug it all around, removed its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. And He built a tower in the middle of it And also hewed out a wine vat in it; Then He expected it to produce good grapes, But it produced only worthless ones."*
> 3. *“And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, Judge between Me and My vineyard.*
> 4. *"What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones?*
> 5. *"So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground.*
> 6. *"I will lay it waste; It will not be pruned or hoed, But briars and thorns will come up. I will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it.”*
> 7. *"For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel And the men of Judah His delightful plant. Thus He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.*

**Matthew 21:33-45 - Parable of the Landowner**

> 33. *“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.*
> 34. *When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce.*
> 35. *The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third.*
> 36. *Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them.*
> 37. *But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’*
> 38. But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’*
> 39. *They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.*
> 40. *Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?”*
> 41. *They said to Him, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons.”*
> 42. Jesus *said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, This became the chief corner stone; This came about from the Lord, And it is marvelous in our eyes’?*
> 43. *Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people, producing the fruit of it.*
> 44. *And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.”*
> 45. *When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.*

**6 Woes of Isaiah 5**

> 1. vs.8 *"Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field, Until there is no more room"*
> 2. vs.11 *"Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink, Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them!"*
> 3. vs.18 *"Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood, And sin as if with cart ropes;"*
> 4. vs.20 *"Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!"*
> 5. vs.21 *"Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes And clever in their own sight!"*
> 6. vs.22 *"Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine And valiant men in mixing strong drink,"*

**Matthew 23:13-36 - Seven Woes**

> 1. vs.13 *“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.*
> 2. vs.14 *Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.* (not in earlier manuscripts)
> 3. vs.15 *“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.*
> 4. vs.16 *“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.’*
> 5. vs.23 *“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.*
> 6. vs.25 *“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.*
> 7. vs.27 *“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.*

## Isaiah Prophecy Fulfillment

**Isaiah demonstrates Immediant, Near-Term, and Far-reaching prophetic definition**

- Many prophecies have:
    - **Historical fulfillment** (Assyria, Babylon, Cyrus)
    - **Messianic fulfillment** (Christ’s first coming)
    - **Eschatological fulfillment** (future kingdom)
- Isaiah demonstrates **predictive prophecy**, not hindsight theology
