**Begin video.**

**Review of the Last Session**

- We have examined Abraham's steps of faith: his going from Ur in obedience to God’s call, his great longing for a son and heir and his obedient faith in offering his son Isaac as a sacrifice.

**Preview**

- We will cover the period of time from the death of Abraham to the end of the book of Genesis. Genesis 25-50
- The primary characters are Isaac, Jacob, Esau, Judah and Joseph.
- This lesson will complete our survey of Genesis in which are the foundations of all major Biblical themes.

**Bible Timeline Bearings**

- Abraham was 75 years old when he left Haran for Canaan. Genesis 12:4
- Abraham lived to be 175 years old. Genesis 25:7
- When Sarah gave birth to Isaac, Abraham was 100 years old. Genesis 21:5
- His lifespan was approximately 2165 BC to 1990 BC.
- Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah. Genesis 25:20
- Isaac lived to be 180 years old. Genesis 35:28
- He was 60 years old when twins Esau and Jacob were born. Genesis 25:26
- Near the end of Jacob's life, he tells Pharaoh he has lived 130 years (Genesis 47:9). Genesis 47:28 records that he lived in Egypt 17 years before he died.
- Rachel gave birth to Jacob's eleventh son, Joseph, when he was 91.
- Genesis ends with Joseph’s death in Egypt at age 110. Genesis 50:22
- From Abraham's death to the death of Joseph is around 186 years from approximately 1990 BC to 1804 BC. There are still questions about some of the dates.

**Key Verses in Biblical Chronology:**

1. **Genesis 15:13** – God tells Abraham that his descendants would be *“strangers in a country not their own,”* and be *“enslaved and mistreated 400 years.”*
1. **1 Kings 6:1** – Solomon began to build the Temple, *“In the 480th year after the Israelites came out of Egypt.”*
1. **Exodus 12:40** – records, *“The length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.”*
1. Conservative Biblical scholars put the Exodus at 1446 BC. Counting back 430 years, puts the arrival of Jacob's family in Egypt at about 1875 BC.

**Primary Focus of our Study of Hebrew Scriptures**

- Jesus Himself said, *“These are the Scriptures that testify about Me.”* **John 5:39b**
- The second half of Genesis is important in tracing Abraham's blessing through his descendants.
- The Genesis 12 blessings to Abraham are both temporal and spiritual.

**Genesis 24 – Finding a Wife for Isaac**

- Abraham was concerned with maintaining a distinction for his descendants from the immoral culture of Canaan.
- We is a strong sense that he is aware of the importance of preserving both a physical and a moral purity because from his family will come the “offspring” who will inherit all that God promised.
- The hope of the fulfillment of God's promises is in each generation of Abraham's children.
- The un-named servant's search for a bride for Isaac carries with it a foreshadowing of the Holy Spirit's ministry in the world of seeking those who would belong to Christ.

**Isaac and Rebekah's twin sons, Jacob and Esau**

- Before their birth, their destinies were revealed to Rebekah. **Genesis 25:23**
- The story of Esau selling his birthright for a pot of stew begins to reveal the
character of each.
- The value of the blessing of Abraham is again emphasized as Jacob, the younger son, schemes to get the blessing and Esau seems indifferent to it.
- We can imagine the suspenseful story of Jacob's deceiving his father being retold countless times in Jewish families.
- Jacob's dishonesty would not be praised, but God did honor the son who most desired the blessing promised to Abraham.
- Although Esau and his descendants, the Edomites, continue to figure in Biblical history, it is through Jacob and his family that the promised *“offspring,”* to bless all the nations in the world, will come.
- After the theft of Esau's blessing, Jacob, at his mother's insistence, journeys to
her homeland.
- On the journey, Jacob in a vision of a *“stairway...with its top reaching to heaven,”* **(Genesis 28:12)** the LORD confirms Jacob's possession of Abraham's blessing. God promises to watch over him and bring him back to the land.

**Jacob's 20 Years of Service to His Cousin Laban**

- Jacob serves 7 years to marry Rachel, but is tricked into marrying her sister Leah. Then he serves 7 more years for Rachel.
- The births of his 12 sons and 1 daughter by these 2 sisters and their servant girls, Bilhah and Zilpah, leads to the founding of the 12 tribes of Israel which are the focus of the rest of the Old Testament. The relationships and interactions among
these 12 brothers and their descendants are the framework for the history of the Old Testament.
- The continued importance placed on the transmission of the blessings promised to Abraham and the expectation of the promised “offspring” are the theme of Hebrew Scriptures.

**Jacob Returns to His Homeland With His Wives and Children**

- Jacob is fearful of both his cousin Laban and his estranged brother, Esau.
- Near the end of his journey, Jacob has an intense encounter with One who must be recognized as the pre-incarnate Jesus, a *“Theophany.”*
- Jacob wrestles with this *“man”* throughout the night until daybreak: *“When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. Then the man said, 'Let me go, for it is daybreak,' But Jacob replied, 'I will not let you go unless you bless me'. The man asked him, 'What is your name?'' Jacob, he answered. Then the man said, 'Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.' Jacob said, 'Please tell me your name.' But he replied, 'Why do you ask my name?' Then he blessed him there. So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, 'It is because I saw God face-to-face, and yet my life was spared.’”* **Genesis 32:25-30**
- From this point on his name is changed from Jacob, meaning *“he grasps the heel”*, to *“Israel”*, meaning *“he struggles with God.”*
- The children of Israel will struggle with God until they recognize Jesus of  Nazareth, the promised *“offspring”*, the One who wrestled with Jacob.

**The Twelve Sons of Israel**

- Several will stand out as those who will receive and carry on the promised blessings of Abraham.
- Judah, the fourth born, will be the focus of the leading or kingly line of descent.
- Reuben, Simeon and Levi, the first three sons, each lose their chance to inherit the blessing because of their sinful choices.
- Joseph, the first-born of Israel's first love, Rachel, will receive the family blessing in his second-born son, Ephraim. (Clearly important later in history, during and after the time of Solomon, son of David of the line of Judah.)

**Joseph, the Firstborn of Israel and Rachel**

- He is the prime character of the final chapters of Genesis.
- He was studied in-depth in the CDI Bibliology class as one of the greatest Old Testament types of Christ.
- Joseph:
    - The special love of his father
    - The rejection of his brothers
    - His suffering
    - His purity
    - His prophetic wisdom
    - His exaltation to ruler-ship
    - The saving of his family
    - The receiving of the blessings promised to Abraham in his son, Ephraim
- Joseph's life is a foreshadowing of the beloved and perfect firstborn Son in and through whom all the blessings of God are found.

**Reviewing the Great Themes of the Bible**

- The end of Joseph's life marks the end of the Book of Beginnings. We have seen the beginning of all things and the beginning of all the great themes of the Bible.
- In creation we are prepared to recognize the Creator through things He has made.
- The Apostle Paul says, *“For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities – His eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.”* **Romans 1:20**
- This powerful God *“is more than one”*, for his name *“Elohim”*, is plural, and when He creates his crowning jewel, he says, *“Let US make man in OUR image, in OUR likeness.”* **(Genesis 1:26, emphasis added)** then He creates two, male and female.
- We have seen sin and death enter the world, *“through one man”* **(Romans 5:12)** and seen the promise that by the *“seed”* or *“offspring,”* (singular) of the woman **(Genesis 3:15)**, the enemy of man would be crushed.
- Genesis began tracing a line of faith through Adam, Seth, Enoch, and Noah, down to Abram who became the *“father of all who believe.”* **Romans 4:11**
- We have learned to look for Jesus in types, such as Enoch, Noah, the Ark and Melchizedek.
- Unique appearances to Abraham and Jacob called *“Theophanies.”*
- The great Flood-judgment of Noah's day caused the earth's great geological features including continents and mountain ranges made of uplifted sediments.
- The account of Babel is the reasonable explanation for separate languages and nations of this one single human race.
- God singled out a man of faith and promised to bring blessing to all the nations of
the earth from him and his descendants.
- Jesus Himself came through the line of Abraham.
- Jesus said, *“These are the Scriptures that testify about Me.”* **John 5:39b**

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at Jesus, Moses and the Law.
- We will examine the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, as after 400 years as slaves in a foreign land, his descendants return to the land of promise.
- Exodus is the great Old Testament pictures of salvation from slavery and death, of the Passover Lamb and the Law that the Apostle Paul called, *“our guardian until Christ came in order that we might be justified by faith.”* **Galatians 3:24 ESV**
