## The Twelve - Zechariah

Zechariah returned from Babylon to Judah with Zerubbabel the governor and Josiah the High Priest. verse 16 adds that he was a priest, the “head of his father’s house”. Zechariah stands alongside Haggai and Malachi as the final prophets of the OT. Zechariah’s name means “Yahweh remembers” which is the perfect message for this moment in Israel’s history.

NT reference to Zechariah, spoken by Jesus Himself and found in the gospels of Matthew and Luke. **Matthew writes in 23.29-35**. listen carefully.  

> *29“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! . 32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. 33 You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? 34 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, 35 so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.*[^2]

Along with other prophets, Zechariah was martyred.[^1]

## Themes

[^1]

1. Jesus Messiah:

> Zechariah is one of the most Christ-centered prophetic books in the OT, second only to Isaiah.  

- His arrival in Jerusalem on the foal of a donkey (9:9)
- His betrayal for the price of thirty pieces of silver (11:12)
- The casting of those silver pieces back into the house of the Lord (11:13)
- His crucifixion (12:10)
- His death as the Shepherd of Israel (13:7)
- a prophecy to which Jesus Himself refers in Matthew 26:31
- His coming in glory and sovereign power (9:10)
- His ingathering of His people (chapter 10)
- His return to the Mount of Olives, creating an earthquake splitting the mount in two (14:4)
- The final, culminating Day of the Lord (chapter 14)

1. Yahweh God:

> Mentioned more than 130 times, He is the covenant God of Israel who acts in power, wisdom, and compassionate love to protect, strengthen, and ultimately redeem His people

1. Repentance:

> from the first chapter, as we’ll see in a few minutes, Zechariah is relentless in his proclamation that Yahweh calls His people to be holy as He is holy

1. Comfort for Israel:

> Finally, this book is the most encouraging message the Judeans could have imagined. it assured them that Yahweh had not forgotten them, or worse, cast them off.

## Chapter 1: Prologue

**A Call to Repentance**  

> *1In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, 2“The Lord was very angry with your fathers. 3Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, “Return to Me,” declares the Lord of hosts, “that I may return to you,” says the Lord of hosts. 4“Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, “Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.” ’ But they did not listen or give heed to Me,” declares the Lord. 5“Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? 6But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, ‘As the Lord of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.’ ” ’ ”*
> --Zechariah 1:1-6[^2]
