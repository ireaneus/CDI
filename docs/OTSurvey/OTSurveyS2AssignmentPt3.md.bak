**Begin video.**

**Preview**

- We will be looking at the first section of the Tanakh, the Law of Moses.
- Point to specific Scriptures that verify Moses as the human author.

**First Five Books of the Old Testament**

- Variously called, *“The Law,”* *“The Torah”* (Hebrew for Law), *“The Pentateuch”* (5 volumes) and the *“Books of Moses.”*
- They are biblically and historically attributed to Moses. The Hebrew Scriptures, the NT writers and Jesus recognized Moses’ authorship.
- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are combined to create the first division of the Tanakh.

**Evidence Supporting the Authorship of Moses**

- *“Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, just the way Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites in the Book of the Law of Moses.”* **Joshua 8:30-31**
- In David’s final words to Solomon he said: *“keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies as it is written in the Law of Moses.”* **1 Kings 2:3**
- Ezra and Nehemiah spoke of Moses as responsible for recording the commands and regulations given by God to His people. **Ezra 7:6; Nehemiah 1:8**
- Numerous references in the Psalms refer to Moses and his history as do the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Micah and Malachi.
- Jesus quoted many passages from the Torah and recognized these as the commands, sayings and writings of Moses. **Matthew 8:4; Mark 7:10; Mark 12:26**
- There are over 80 references in the New Testament identifying Moses as the author of the Pentateuch.
- Attempts have been made to see different authors contributing over a later time period to these books but these theories have been rejected with confidence by both Scriptural testimony and solid Biblical scholarship.
- These theories grew out of a worldview that man and his communicative abilities had evolved slowly from inferior species over great time.
- These theories grew from a determined rejection of the historical accounts given in the Scriptures.

**Moses**

- Important facts help us understand Moses’ unique position historically as God’s choice for these foundational inspired books.
- Moses does not enter the timeline of the Torah until the book of Exodus.
- Exodus tells the remarkable story of Moses’ royal upbringing.
- Stephen, the first martyr, confirms in Acts 7 that Moses was educated *“in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.”* **Acts 7:22**
- Egypt, at the time of Moses’ birth was arguably the greatest nation on earth.
- Moses’ schooling would have given him unlimited access to millions of documents or books in hundreds of organized collections.
- Prior to his official education, Moses was in his own Hebrew mother’s care from his earliest years.
- Moses would have had been acquainted with ancient creation and flood stories and genealogies, especially the oral tradition handed down from his own people.
- Our understanding of the *doctrine of inspiration* tells us that the Spirit of God enabled Moses to write, likely with the assistance of numerous manuscripts, the true record of God’s creative acts and the history of His people from Adam to the time of the Exodus.
- From the exodus on, Moses’ account of the events of Exodus through Deuteronomy was that of an eye-witness and participant.
- The time of the writing of Genesis has been much debated. There are several considerations that suggest Genesis was written during the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites.
- Moses’ early training and familiarity with his people’s history likely came from his mother who was actually paid by Pharaoh’s daughter to be his nurse. **Exodus 2:7-10**

**Timeline of Moses**

- The writer of Hebrews tells us that prior to his 40 years of exile in Midian, Moses had already identified himself with his people.
- Though his motives were right he had some hard lessons to learn about humility and leadership in the school of shepherding.
- When he was 80 years old **(Exodus 7:7)**, God called to him from the burning bush to go back to Egypt to lead his people to freedom.
- He was reluctant but eventually yielded to God’s command. **Exodus 3-4**
- The 10 plagues sent by God to bring judgment on the gods of Egypt **(Exodus 12:12)**, appear to have occurred in less than a year’s time.
- Scripture gives an accurate account of the time from the Exodus to Mount Sinai and up to the beginning of the 40 years of wandering. **Exodus 19:1; 40:17; Numbers 1:1**
- Moses’ task of leading a nation of former slaves was a great challenge.
- Already noted writing and reading were available to Moses and his people. One of Moses’ tasks would have been to give his people a sense of their history and uniqueness as a people chosen by God.
- The narrative of Creation and the tracing of their heritage were essential to give the Israelites the true sense of their place in God’s purposes.
- Genesis gave to this nation of ex-slaves the foundation for their future.

**Significance of Genesis**

- The book of Genesis is truly the starting point of all major doctrines and themes in the Bible.
- It is of first importance that we recognize that the history recorded in Genesis is just and primarily that – history.
- There are portions of Hebrew poetry and some narrative that could be called *“exalted narrative”* because it flows with a rhythm and elegance handed down as an oral tradition for over 20 centuries.
- There is no Biblical, historical, or archeological evidence that would lead us to think of Genesis in any other terms than as an actual historical record of facts and dates and events.

**Preview**

- We will take a closer look at the book of Exodus in Session 6.
- Keep in mind that Moses lived the events of Exodus through Deuteronomy and recorded in real time the history of those 40 years.
- Genesis prepared the people of Israel to know their special place in God’s plan and in his heart.
- Session 3 will be an in-depth look at the first chapters of Genesis.
- In the opening pages of Scripture we will find clues to the nature of God the Creator and the starting point of all the major themes and doctrines of the Bible.

Here the adventure begins.
