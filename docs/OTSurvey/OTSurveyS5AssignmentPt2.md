**Begin video.**

**Review of the Last Session**

- Abraham's going in faith looking for a *“city with foundations whose architect and builder is God.”* **Hebrews 11:10b**
- Abraham's *“great longing for a son.”* He believed God's promise that he would have a son/heir even though it seemed impossible by earthly standards.
- Abraham's faith was *“credited to him as righteousness.”* **Genesis 15:6**
- Abraham is called the *“father of all who believe.”* **Romans 4:11**
- Abraham's longing for a son and heir, believing God's promises is a critical step in God's plan to bring Jesus, the *“offspring of Abraham,”* **(Galatians 3:16)** to fulfill all of His promised blessings to all who believe.

**Abraham’s Faith**

- The story of Abraham’s faith, the *“Giving”* of his son Isaac as a sacrifice.
- Genesis 22 is one of the most important events of the Old Testament.
- It is the record of the obedience of Abraham’s faith.
- More than any other story in the Hebrew Scriptures, the story of Abraham’s offering his son points to the cross and to our God who *“so loved the world that He gave His one and only son.”* **John 3:16**
- Look at Genesis 22 from 3 different perspectives:
    - Abraham’s point-of-view – he takes his son to the region of Moriah to offer him as a sacrifice.
    - See Isaac as a type of Christ, God’s one and only Son.
    - Consider God’s view of Abraham’s obedient faith as He saw the future sacrifice of His one and only son, Jesus, *“…slain from the creation of the world.”* **Revelation 13:8**

**Abraham's Point of View**

- The facts of God's instruction to Abraham and his unquestioning obedience are difficult to grasp.
- There is no hint of any argument, no question, no hesitation. Abraham believed Isaac was the answer to his prayers for a son and heir.
- To offer that son *“as a burnt offering”* **(Genesis 22:2)** appears to be an impossible obstacle to the fulfillment of God's promise.
- In Hebrews we are told *“Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead”* **(Hebrews 11:19)** because he knew that *“through Isaac” [his] offspring would be reckoned.”* **Genesis 21:12**
- Abraham's instant obedience is remarkable: *“Early the next morning He got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac.”* **Genesis 22:3a**
- They set out, after cutting *“enough wood for the burnt offering.”* **Genesis 22:3b.**

**The journey takes three days.**

- **Genesis 22:5** is a vital clue to Abraham's thoughts and his faith. He says to the servants, *“Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then **we** will come back to you.”*
- Abraham fully meant to offer up Isaac and fully expected that both he and Isaac would return.
- The wood for the burnt offering being placed on Isaac is a perfect picture of Christ
and His cross on the road to Golgotha.
- The knife and fire also prepare us to understand the judgment of God that fell upon His Son.
- Isaac’s question, *“Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”* **(Genesis 22:7b)** leads to one of the most profound statements in Scripture. Abraham answered, *“God Himself will provide the lamb”* **(Genesis 22:8, NIV)** or *“God will provide Himself a lamb”* (KJV). Jesus’ own words in **John 8:56** took these things into account: *“Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad.”*
- Abraham bound his son, Isaac, laid him on the altar and reached out with the knife in his hand fully intending to obey God's command to sacrifice Isaac.
- God’s word confirms this for he says, *“Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from Me your son, your only son.”* **Genesis 22:12**

**Isaac's Point of View**

- Isaac is a type of Christ. He is the promised son, the beloved son, and, in God's own words, the *“only son”* **(Genesis 22:2, 12, 16)** of Abraham.
- Isaac heard his father's words, that the two of them would worship and then return, so trusting his father, he carried the wood for the burnt offering.
- There is no hint of resistance on his part as he yielded to his father's will. Just imagine that trust as he allowed his father to bind him and lay him on the altar!
- In this we can see Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane saying, *“My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”* **Matthew 26:39**
- The writer of Hebrews tells us that, *“figuratively speaking, [Abraham] did receive Isaac back from death.”* **Hebrews 11:19**
- The main focus is on the faith of the father, the son *“figuratively speaking”*, experienced death and in a sense, also a resurrection.

**God's Point of View**

- Abraham was commanded to do what God himself would do: offer his Son, his only Son. God the Father watched Abraham's unhesitating obedience, but He had unyielding determination to *“provide, Himself, a lamb.”* **Genesis 22:8**
- There is much teaching here about Jesus' obedience and suffering in going to the
cross.
- Just as Abraham must have suffered on the journey to Moriah, God the Father suffered as He *“gave His only begotten Son.”* **John 3:16**
- Christ's sacrificial death was the will of God. Peter said that Christ was handed
over to those who took his life *“by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge.”* **Acts
2:23**
- In praying for boldness, the church in **Acts 4:24-30**, reminds God that those who crucified Jesus did only *“what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.”* **Acts 4:28**
- Isaiah, in looking back to Abraham and forward to the cross says, *“Yet it was the LORD's will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer, and though the LORD makes His life an offering for sin, He will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in His hand.”* **Isaiah 53:10**

**God the Son's View of Isaac's Obedience**

- The eternal Son of God was there on Mount Moriah calling out to Abraham, *“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” He said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.”* **Genesis 22:12**
- It is astounding that though Abraham was asked to offer Isaac, God stopped him and provided a *“ram caught by its horns”* **(Genesis 22:13)**, but 2000 years later, when Jesus carried the cross up the same mountain, God did not stop the sacrifice, but rather offered His Son, His only Son, *“the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.”* **John 1:29**

**The Significance of Mount Moriah**

- God told Abraham, *“Go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”* **Genesis 22:2**
- On this same mountain, David saw the angel sent to bring a plague on Jerusalem and offered a burnt offering that ended God's wrath. David said, *“The house of the LORD God is to be here, and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”* **1 Chronicles 22:1a**
- On Mount Moriah, Solomon built the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, *“where the LORD had appeared to his father David.”* **2 Chronicles 3:1**
- Isaiah prophesied: *“On this mountain He will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; He will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; He will remove His people's disgrace from all the earth. The LORD has spoken. In that day they will say, 'Surely this is our God; we trusted in Him, and He saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in Him; let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.' The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain.”* **Isaiah 25:7-10**
- In the very place of Abraham's faith and Isaac's obedience, God Himself provided
the Lamb!

**Review**

- Genesis 22 is the powerful foreshadowing of the sacrifice of Jesus.
- In the previous session, we saw the first two steps of Abraham's faith: his going in search of an eternal city and his great longing for a son and heir.
- In this lesson, we looked at Abraham's obedient offering of his son from three perspectives:
    - Abraham's faith
    - What Isaac's trusting obedience reveals about Jesus
    - What God the Father and God the Son saw in *“the fullness of time”* **Galatians 4:4**, the Son of God would offer Himself as the Lamb.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- The time from Abraham to the great events surrounding Moses and the exodus.
