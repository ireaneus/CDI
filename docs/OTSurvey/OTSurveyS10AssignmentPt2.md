**Begin video.**

**Review of The Previous Session**

- Overview of the early Minor Prophets: *Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah and Micah.*
- Ministered during the time of the divided kingdom.
- Amos and Jonah were well before the fall of Samaria.
- Exact time of Obadiah’s and Jonah’s ministries is not certain, but they are included here with the early Minor Prophets because these books are generally arranged chronologically.
- Hosea and Micah lived and ministered through the time of the fall of the kingdom of Israel.
- Joel and Micah directed their messages to the people of Jerusalem.
- Hosea and Amos proclaimed the word of the LORD primarily to Israel.
- Hosea lived in Israel and the LORD sent Amos there from Judah.
- Messages of Jonah and Obadiah directed against other nations—Jonah was sent to Nineveh and Obadiah spoke against Edom.

**Messages of the Prophets**

- We will look at the messages of the prophets, *Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah.*
- They lived during the 140 years between the destruction of Samaria and the destruction of Jerusalem.
- The international landscape changed dramatically. Assyria, after destroying Samaria, had attempted to conquer Jerusalem also.
- As we learned in our study of Isaiah, the LORD rescued Jerusalem by miraculously destroying the Assyrian army.
- Weakened by this loss, Assyria, was not able to keep the Medes and Babylonians from gaining their independence.
- These two nations then combined to destroy Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, in 612 B.C. Following this, as Isaiah had foretold (**Isaiah 39:5-6**), Babylon became the power to be feared by the people of the Holy Land.

**Nahum’s Prophecy**

- About the coming destruction of Nineveh. What Jonah had hoped for would finally happen.
- Nahum’s message is all about the coming destruction of Nineveh and begins:
    - *“The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath.”* **Nahum 1:1-2**
- The wrath of God against his enemies is being described:
    - *“Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.”* **Nahum 1:6**
- Nineveh had been the LORD’s instrument to bring judgment on Israel but now Nineveh would also be judged.
- Two reasons Nahum’s prophecy is placed after the fall of Samaria but before the fall of Jerusalem:
    - First: Strong similarities between his messages and those of Isaiah whose later ministry was after the deliverance of Jerusalem. Evidence in the text of Nahum that leads most scholars to place his ministry near or within a generation after Isaiah. **Nahum 1:15** is nearly a direct quote from **Isaiah 52:7**.
    - Second: Nahum clearly predicts the future destruction of Nineveh. His vision of Nineveh’s destruction must have been given before 612 B.C.
- Nineveh was an ancient city, first mentioned in **Genesis 10:11**.
- As the capital of Assyria, it was considered too strong to be destroyed.
- When the combined armies of Babylon and Media surrounded Nineveh, Nahum’s words came true:
    - *“…with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh.”* **Nahum 1:8**
- Flooding of the Tigris River caused part of the city wall to collapse and Nineveh was destroyed.

**Habakkuk’s Message**

- Concerns the coming destruction of Jerusalem.
- The first two chapters are a conversation between Habakkuk and the LORD.
- The third chapter is the prophet’s prayer of submission as he is given a vision of the power and glory of God.
- Habakkuk’s message begins when he asks God to do something about evil: *“How long, LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, ‘Violence!’ but you do not save? Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.”* **Habakkuk 1:2-3**
- The LORD’s answer was not what Habakkuk hoped for. The LORD tells him that He is raising up the Babylonians as His instrument of judgment: *“Look at the nations and watch—and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told. I am raising up the Babylonians.”* **Habakkuk 1:5-6**
- Habakkuk’s response was one of disbelief. How could God, the Holy One, use wicked Babylonians to judge his people? **Habakkuk 1:12-13**
- God answers in chapter 2 and reveals that Babylon would also be judged.
- All who practice evil will be judged, “but the righteous will live by his faith.” **Habakkuk 2:4**
- Paul uses this same phrase in **Romans 1:17** and **Galatians 3:11**, and the writer of Hebrews uses it in **Hebrews 10:38**, to proclaim the essence of the Gospel of Christ… *“The just shall live by faith.”*
- In chapter 3, Habakkuk’s prayer was a combination of a vision of the LORD’s splendor and a humble submission to God’s sovereign power: *“I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us. Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior."* **Habakkuk 3:16-18**

**Zephaniah – Sometimes Called the “Royal Prophet”**

- Though several generations removed, he was a descendant of King Hezekiah. **Zephaniah 1:1**
- During the reign of his relative, Josiah, he boldly condemned the sins of Jerusalem and announced its coming destruction: *“I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,”* declares the LORD. *“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place.”* **Zephaniah 1:2, 4**
- Zephaniah’s message from the LORD was to the prophet’s own peers—the wealthy, the complacent and those of royal birth: *“On the day of the LORD’s sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king’s sons and all those clad in foreign clothes…at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, ‘The LORD will do nothing, either good or bad.’ Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished.”* **Zephaniah 1:8, 12-13**
- Even in anticipation of the wrath of God on *“the great day of the LORD,”* (**Zephaniah 1:14**), Zephaniah also had a message of hope: *“Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, you who do what He commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD’s anger.”* **Zephaniah 2:3**
- The LORD pronounced judgment, through Zephaniah, against the Philistines (**Zephaniah 2:4-7**), Moab and Ammon (**Zephaniah 2:8-11**), Cush (**Zephaniah 2:12**) and Assyria. (**Zephaniah 2:13-15**)
- The message against Nineveh, placed Zephaniah’s ministry in the same time frame as Nahum and Habakkuk.
- Zephaniah’s final message in chapter 3 begins with words of woe against Jerusalem’s officials and rulers whom he called *“roaring lions”* and *“evening wolves.”* **Zephaniah 3:3**
- He says the city’s prophets were arrogant and treacherous men, *“her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law.”* **Zephaniah 3:4**
- Though destruction was certain, the LORD’s promises to Abraham’s children would not fail: *“On that day they will say to Jerusalem, ‘Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp. The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love He will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.’”* **Zephaniah 3:16-17**
- Zephaniah’s last message concludes with this word from the LORD: *“I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,” says the LORD.* **Zephaniah 3:20**

**Review**

- This session covered the word of the LORD that came through *Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah*.
- These three prophets lived in the years just *before* Jerusalem’s destruction.
- Nahum prophesied concerning the coming destruction of Nineveh.
- Habakkuk and Zephaniah recognized the wickedness in Jerusalem and warned the people of the coming righteous judgment of God.
- Note that these three prophets are contemporaries of Jeremiah.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will study the last three Minor Prophets: *Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi*.
- These were sent by the LORD to the Jews who returned to Jerusalem following the *70 years of captivity in Babylon*. (Add to your timeline.)
