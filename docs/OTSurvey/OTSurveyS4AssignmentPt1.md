**Review of the Last Session**

- Jesus the Creator is at the center of God's plan.
- Jesus walked in the Garden of Eden and asked man, *“Where are you?”*
- Jesus spoke words of judgment to the serpent and to our first parents.
- Jesus also spoke words of hope to them.

**The Theme of Redemption**

- Begins in Genesis 3.
- Answers the question *“Why is there evil in the world?”*
    - In his book, If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, Randy Alcorn points out this question as being one of the most common asked by unbelievers and says that it is the most common argument used to deny God’s existence.

**The Temptation of Eve and Adam**

- It is essential for us to understand the broken condition of our world and mankind in particular.
- The serpent questioned Eve and openly contradicted God's Word.
- Eve gave in to the lies of the father of lies. *“When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was: good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.”* **Genesis 3:6**

**The Three Aspects of Temptation**

- The first was simply physical. Eve *“saw that the fruit was good for food.”*
- The second was to her soul, her imagination: “pleasing to the eye.”
- The third was spiritual: *“desirable for gaining wisdom.”*
- Seen in the three times the devil tests Jesus in the wilderness. **(Matt 4; Lk 4).**
    - The temptation in the garden and of Jesus in the wilderness are purposely paralleled in Scripture.
    - The nature of temptation is revealed.
    - This shows Jesus to be **“the last Adam,” (1 Corinthians 15:45)**, who did not sin and who rightly holds dominion over all creation.

**Kindness, Sternness and Purposes of God Following the Fall of Mankind**

- KINDNESS: God came looking for man.
- STERNNESS and PURPOSES: God's judgment on the serpent with the first prediction of the eventual victory of Christ: *“So the LORD God said to the serpent, ‘Because you have done this, cursed are you above all the livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.’”* **Genesis 3:14-15**
- God's great plan of redemption begins with the revelation that the final triumph of God over evil will be accomplished by One *“born of a woman,”* **Galatians 4:4**, who will Himself be wounded yet victorious.
- Adam and Eve surely felt dread at God's words of judgment because they knew that the command they had broken carried with it a death sentence!

**The Redemptive Plan of God Made Clear**

- *“The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.”* **Genesis 3:21**
- This was the first sacrifice.
- This was the first death of a substitute.
- God was showing that, though death was the penalty for sin, atonement (a covering), could be had at another's expense.

**The Triune Nature of God**  
*“The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever. So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.”* **Genesis 3:22-23**

**Mankind's Fallen State**

- The immediate effects of sin in the tragedy of Cain and Abel
- It continues in the arrogant ungodliness of Cain and his descendants
- In contrast, we also see a line of faith through Seth

**Names from Adam to Noah Genesis 5**

- In the meanings of the names, we recognize a hint of man's hope of a suffering Savior.
    - Your Bible timeline needs to include these names and their respective ages to get a sense of the passage of time from Adam to Noah.
- It is likely that early events were transmitted verbally from generation to generation.
- These great ages became impossible likely due to genetic flaws and radical changes in the world after the Flood.
- There is no reason to doubt God's detailed account of these early generations before the Flood.
- Luke 3 confirms this list.

**Early Chapters of Genesis**  
Things of note to considered about Enoch

- Enoch, the seventh from Adam, is a contrasting picture to the depravity of man.
- Enoch *“walked with God.”* **Genesis 5:22**
- According to **Jude 14-15**, Enoch was a prophet and his prophetic declaration is one of the strongest condemnations of *“the ungodly”* in all of Scripture. Enoch's words correspond with the Lord's own evaluation of the world of Noah's day. See **Genesis 6:5-6**
- Enoch's prophetic gift may also be seen in the name of his son, *Methuselah*, which means *“when he dies, it shall come.”* The Flood occurred the year Methuselah died.
- **Hebrews 11:5** states, *“He was commended as one who pleased God.”*
- Enoch's bold faith in the midst of an ungodly world is a powerful testimony.
- His unique departure from this life prepares us to see the risen, victorious Jesus in His ascension.
- Enoch is also a foreshadowing of believers who, without dying, will enter the Lord's presence at His coming. **1 Thessalonians 4:17**

**Genesis 6**

- The opening statements (controversial Nephilim not defined here) describe a world of desperate wickedness: *“The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the
human heart was only evil all the time.”* **Genesis 6:5**
- Jesus confirmed this wickedness in **Matthew 24:37-39a**: *“As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of man. For in the days before the Flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the Ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the Flood came and took them all away.”*
- In **Genesis 6:13**, we read that God spoke directly to Noah, saying, *“I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.”*
- Everything God says and does is in complete unity and agreement – so we must see Jesus here, present with Noah and expressing his indignation and coming wrath. In doing so, God prepares Noah for a coming great destruction.
- God instructs Noah to prepare a place of safety, the Ark.
- The Ark and the entire Flood predict an even greater destruction and one perfect place of safety.

**Review**

- The answer to the questions, *“Why is there evil in the world?”* and *“Why is there death?”*
- God's Word points us to His answer to these questions, not only telling us *“Why,”* but *“What”* He is planning to do.
- God provides a way for sin to be atoned for and for final victory over the serpent to come through the wounding of Eve's offspring.
- God hates sin and all its tragic effects and He will act in both judgment and mercy to conquer sin.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- We will look at the account of Noah, God’s judgment in the Flood and His grace in providing a place of safety – the Ark.

## Question: Why did God create darkness, sea, and sin, all that provision for Evil, when the new Heavens, and Earth will not have these things?

## Answer

**Why? It was because of what He did before the creation**

Before the creation, God purposed — from eternity — to **display the fullness of His glory**. His justice, holiness, mercy, grace, patience, and love were not created traits — they are **eternal perfections** of His being.

To manifest the **riches of who He is**, He ordained a redemptive plan that would **glorify Himself** by redeeming a people through His Son — not because He needed them, but because His love and glory are **overflowing**.

Creation, the fall, and redemption were never about human need — they were about **divine purpose**. Man’s ability to choose was part of a far greater plan: that through redemption, **God would be seen as He truly is**.

### Scripture affirms this eternal, God-centered purpose

- **He chose us before time — for the praise of His glory**
  *“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, **to the praise of the glory of His grace**…”*
  — *Ephesians 1:5–6*

- **He endured evil to make His glory known**
  *“What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath… did so to **make known the riches of His glory** upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory…”*
  — *Romans 9:22–23*

- **He fully revealed His nature in Christ**
  *“He is the radiance of His glory and the exact imprint of His nature…”*
  — *Hebrews 1:3*

- **He poured out love to demonstrate Himself**
  *“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”*
  — *Romans 5:8*

---

### In other words

- *It was according to the good pleasure of His will* — *Ephesians 1:5*
- *To make known the riches of His glory* — *Romans 9:23*
- *To reveal the radiance of His Son* — *Hebrews 1:3*
- *To display the depths of divine love* — *Romans 5:8*
- *All to the praise of His glorious grace* — *Ephesians 1:6*

## Summary

If we were created like Adam and Jesus (good, able to choose to obey or disobey), but without the capability to sin, the only side to God we would see would be His perfection, which in and of itself is awesome, but we wouldn't be able to experience or see all of His attributes, His Love, Mercy, Forgiveness, Justice and Wrath, to name a few.

God created man with the capacity to choose — not for man’s sake, but for **His own glory’s sake**.

In the fullness of time, through the fall and redemption, He displays:

- the **justice** that judges sin
- the **mercy** that withholds wrath
- the **grace** that saves
- and the **love** that gives Christ

All of this flows not from lack, but from the **overflow of who He is** — for **from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.**
(*Romans 11:36*)
