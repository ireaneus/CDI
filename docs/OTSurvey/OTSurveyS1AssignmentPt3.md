- Note significant Old Testament covenants enacted, and the parties involved.
- Distinguish between the “New Covenant” and the “Old Covenant.”

Preview

- We will examine the word *“Testament,”* and why our Bibles are divided between and Old Testament and a New Testament.
- These terms have misled some to consider the OT as inferior.

**The New is in the Old contained, the Old is in the New explained. The New is in the Old concealed, the Old is in the New revealed.**

Defining a *“Covenant”*

- We typically use the word, *“testament,”* in the context of a persons “Will.” Words that carry the same meaning are agreement, contract, or covenant.
- The word translated *“Testament,”* might be better translated *“Covenant.”*
- Biblically speaking, a covenant carries the idea of a special contract between parties who are often unequal in power or influence.
- In the case of *“covenant”* as a *“will,”* this is an agreement that goes into effect when the person making the will dies. Hebrew 9:16-18

Covenants in Scripture

- There are a number of *“Covenants”* in Scripture.

*“Noahic Covenant”*

- The first use of the word *“covenant”* is in Genesis 6:18, where God promises to make a covenant with Noah.
- This promise is fulfilled and the covenant enacted in Genesis 9:9-17. *“I now establish My covenant with you and with your descendants after you…”* Genesis 9:9
- This is called the *“Noahic Covenant,”* established following the sacrifices Noah offers when he and all with him come out of the Ark after the flood.
- God declares that he will never again destroy all life by a flood of water.
- The rainbow is considered the sign of this covenant.
- This *“Noahic Covenant”* is still in effect today.

*“Abrahamic Covenant”*

- The *“Abrahamic Covenant”* of Genesis 15:18, was confirmed in Genesis 17:1-22. The LORD promises to make a great nation from Abraham’s descendants.
- The covenant ritual performed in Genesis 15 involved the pledge of God alone without the involvement of a second party; this demonstrates the absolute unwavering promise of God to accomplish all that the *“Abrahamic Covenant”* entails.

*“Mosaic Covenant”*

- Perhaps the best known covenant in the Bible is associated with Moses and the Law.
- This often referred to as the Mosaic Covenant or simply, The Law.
- The Ten Commandments are the focal point of this covenant. Exodus 20; Deuteronomy 5
- In these contexts are given detailed instructions concerning moral and civil codes of living.
- *“Then he [Moses] took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, ‘We will do everything the LORD has said; we will obey.’ Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, ‘This is the blood of the Covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with these words.’”* Exodus 24:7-8
- It is important to note that the *“death”* that ratifies this covenant is a substitutionary one, the blood of sacrificial animals.
- The New Testament, or New Covenant, makes reference to the Law of Moses as *“the Old Covenant.”* Romans 7:6; 2 Corinthians 3:14; Hebrews 8:6
- Paul has a great deal to say about the Law and its relation to the New Covenant of grace.
- We have to be careful to make a distinction between the Law of Moses or the Mosaic covenant, and the entire Hebrew Scriptures.
- We call the Hebrew Scriptures, Genesis through Malachi, the *“Old Testament”* when in fact, the New Covenant references to the Old Covenant primarily refer to the Mosaic covenant or the Law.
- The entire Hebrew Scriptures were first called the *“Old Testament”* by a 2nd century Christian writer named Melito, from Sardis.
- To call all of the Hebrew Scriptures the *“Old Testament”* may be misleading.

*“Davidic Covenant”*

- In 2 Samuel 7 and 1 Chronicles 17, God promises King David a son who would sit in His throne and reign forever.
- In 2 Samuel 23:5 David speaks of this promise as an *“…everlasting covenant, arranged and secured in every part.”*
- This covenant looks forward specifically to Jesus, the *“son of David.”*

*“New Covenant”*

- Hebrew Scriptures speak prophetically of a future *“New Covenant.”*
- The LORD spoke of this through the prophet Jeremiah because of the Jews’ failure to keep the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt. He said he would make a new covenant with them.

> *“The days are coming,”* declares the Lord, *“when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.*  
> *It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,”* declares the Lord.  
> *“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,”* declares the Lord. *“I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,”* declares the Lord. *“For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”*  
> --Jeremiah 31:31-34

- This new covenant was promised at a time of great judgment on the nation of Israel, a message of hope and promise.
- This reference relates specifically to the Mosaic Covenant but it does not affect the covenants with Abraham and Noah.
- Hebrews 8-9 makes the strong statement concerning the relation of the *“first covenant”* and the *“new covenant”* that *“by calling this covenant ‘new,’ He has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.”* Hebrews 9:13
- The word *“obsolete”* does not mean useless, rather that, in relation to the New Covenant, the Old has served its purpose. This statement is made in reference to the Law and does not affect other covenants God has made with men or nations.
- When Jesus says, *“This cup is the new covenant in my blood,”* (Luke 22:20), he does not nullify the Covenants with Abraham and Noah, but he fulfills the promise of Jeremiah 31 and of the new and better covenant.
- The apostle Paul clarifies the relation between the Law and the New Covenant in the epistles to the Romans and to the Galatian churches.
- Paul points out that the Law, though it is *“holy, righteous and good”* (Romans 7:12), rather than bringing salvation reveals our need of a Savior.

> *What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions…Is the law, therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.*  
> --Galatians 3:19-22

- Paul states in Romans 9 that Israel, entrusted with the law, did not receive the gift of righteousness through the Law: *“Why not? Because they pursued it [righteousness], not by faith but as if it were by works.”* Romans 9:32
- The primary object is to show that the entire Hebrew Scriptures, what we have comfortably called the *“Old Testament,”* are certainly not *“obsolete”* but in fact hold the key to understanding and appreciating the New Covenant in Jesus’ blood.
