**Begin video.**

**Review of the Previous Session**

- Overview of the three largest prophetic books in Hebrew Scriptures – Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
- Isaiah ministered in Jerusalem during the time of the fall of Samaria and the kingdom of Israel.
- Jeremiah and Ezekiel were contemporaries. Jeremiah ministered in Jerusalem during its final days and witnessed its destruction.
- Ezekiel’s ministry was with the exiles taken from Jerusalem to Babylon.

**The Twelve**

- The final book of the second section of the Tanakh, *“The Prophets,”* is called *“The Twelve.”*
- This is a collection of the shorter prophetic writings.
- The Twelve likely were combined in one volume so as not to lose track of any of them.
- These books are often referred to as *“The Minor Prophets”* because of their size. This in no way diminishes their value. *“The Twelve”* are arranged chronologically, to a certain extent, and with a few exceptions, we will consider them in the order they appear in Scripture.
- It is always helpful, when possible, to locate the books of Scripture on a Bible timeline.
- This historical context will make us aware of the events taking place at the time the prophet lived and wrote. This gives us a helpful background to understand the prophet’s message.
- Only Joel and Obadiah don’t have clear information about when they were written. We would be fairly safe in assigning them to earlier dates simply because they’re listed in the first part of *“The Twelve.”*
- We will look at the six prophets who lived and wrote prior to or around the time of the fall of Samaria and the northern kingdom of Israel. They are *Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah and Micah*.
- In Part 2 we will consider the three prophets who were contemporaries of Jeremiah near the time of Jerusalem’s fall. They are *Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah*.
- In Part 3 of this session we will look at the remaining three *“Minor Prophets,”* whose ministry was to the Jews who returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity. They are *Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi*.

**Hosea – Historical Background**

- A contemporary of Isaiah during the fall of Samaria.
- Jonah and Amos were earlier prophets.
- Hosea is first in this study for two reasons:
    - First – It is listed first in this collection of shorter works.
    - Second – Hosea was the only prophet of *“the Twelve”* who actually lived in the northern kingdom of Israel. His ministry was to that portion of the divided kingdom.
- Hosea is the longest book of this collection.
- Time frame of his ministry given in **Hosea 1:1:** *“during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam II, son of Joash king of Israel.”*
- This Jeroboam was the 14th king of Israel and great grandson of Jehu who had been promised that his sons would reign for four generations. **2 Kings 10:30**
- Because Hosea prophesied into the reign of Hezekiah he would have lived during the reigns of the final seven kings of Israel and witnessed Samaria’s destruction.

**Hosea’s Ministry**

- Hosea brings the word of the LORD, but his life was his message.
- At the beginning of his ministry he is told by the LORD, *“Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness.”* **Hosea 1:2**
- His marriage to an unfaithful wife was to picture the unfaithfulness of Israel to the LORD.
- Hosea’s children were given names that spoke of the LORD’s relationship to his people:
    - Jezreel – his first son – a message of judgment on the house of Jehu.
    - Lo-Ruhamah – his first daughter – *“not loved.”*
    - Lo-Ammi – his second son – *“not my people”* spoke of the LORD’s rejection of his people in **Hosea 1:4–9**
- Through Hosea the LORD extended hope, *“I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.’ I will say to those called ‘Not my people,’ ‘You are my people’; and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”* **Hosea 2:23**
- Throughout Hosea’s ministry he spoke of the LORD’s longing for his people to return to him.
- Some of the most heart-wrenching and yet hopeful verses of Scripture come from Hosea.
    - *“For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.”* **Hosea 6:6**
    - **Hosea 11:8**: *“How can I give you up, Ephraim?...my heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.”*
    - **Hosea 13:14**: *“I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, is your destruction?”*
    - As Hosea’s broken heart was faithful to his wife, the LORD called to his people, *“I will heal their waywardness and love them freely.”* **Hosea 14:4**
- Jesus’ love for us cries out through Hosea’s message.

[OTSurvey - Chapters of Hosea](/OTSurvey/OTSurveyHosea/)

**Joel – the Second Prophet of “The Twelve”**

- Tells of a plague of locusts that at some time invaded Judah.
- His message is a call to the people of Jerusalem to see, in this plague, the judgment of God and to repent.
- Joel cries out, *“Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, ...Who knows? He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing.”* Joel 2:13–14
- Apostle Peter quoted Joel in his sermon on the Day of Pentecost: *“I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy...and everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved.”* Joel 2:28, 32
- Joel’s final message gave a sense of the apocalypse, the Revelation of Jesus.
- He sees, far in the future, a great battle and the final, victorious coming of the LORD.

**Amos – the Third Prophet of “The Twelve”**

- Ministered during the reign of Uzziah in Jerusalem and Jeroboam II in Samaria – around 780 BC.
- His ministry was *“two years before the earthquake.”* (Amos 1:1) This earthquake *“in the days of Uzziah”* is mentioned in Zechariah 14:5, but nothing else is known of this event.
- Amos was from Tekoa, a small village, several miles south of Bethlehem.
- Sent by the LORD to condemn the idolatry in the northern kingdom, Israel.
- He says, *“I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore fig trees. But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’”* **Amos 7:14–15**
- Opening message denounces the nations surrounding Israel, including Judah.
- Primary message: Israel, too, will soon be judged.
- Amos not a trained speaker, but his messages were eloquent and powerful.
- He was a keen observer of life: *“The lion has roared – who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken – who can but prophesy?”* **Amos 3:8**
- Repeats key, important phrases: *“For three sins of...even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath].”* Amos 1:3, 6, 9, etc.
- In Chapter 4: *“...yet you have not returned to me.”* Amos 4:6, 8, 9, etc.
- Chapter 5 he offers hope with the repeated plea: *“Seek me and live.”* Amos 5:4, 6, 14
- Uses simple illustrations to convey the LORD’s message.
- At the climax of his ministry, Chapter 7, he speaks of swarms of locusts, judgment by fire and a plumb line.
- In Chapter 8 he compares Israel to a basket of ripe fruit – Israel is ripe for judgment.
- Message is ignored and Israel’s destruction to be unavoidable.
- This shepherd from Tekoa ends his messages with words of hope: *“I will plant Israel in their own land, never again to be uprooted...”* says the LORD your God. **Amos 9:15**

**Obadiah – A Message Against Edom**

- Edom – the descendants of Esau.
- Message summed up in verses 10–11, *“Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame, you will be destroyed forever. On the day [of his judgment], you stood aloof, while strangers carried off his wealth...you were like one of them.”*
- Edom will be destroyed and *“there will be no survivors.”* Obadiah 18
- Two parts of Obadiah, verses 1–4; 5–6, are also found in Jeremiah. Some believe Obadiah and Jeremiah were contemporaries or Jeremiah was quoting the earlier prophet. Whatever the case, the message is of Edom’s end.

**Jonah – Best Known of the Minor Prophets**

- Mentioned in **2 Kings 14:25**, during the reign of Jeroboam II.
- He is told to go to wicked *“Nineveh and preach against it.”* (Jonah 1:2), but he runs the other way. Jonah is a study in contrasts and irony. He would rather die than obey the LORD.
- He suspects that God will be gracious to those who deserve his wrath.
- He has somewhat of a change of heart inside a great fish but never really agrees with God.
- The LORD does have compassion on Nineveh, the prophet refuses to.
- Message of the book is that God is compassionate.
- Jonah’s life is a picture of one who has experienced God’s grace, but refuses to offer it to others.
- Nineveh survived another 150 years.
- Nahum’s prophecy (Part 2 of this session), tells of Nineveh’s final destruction.
- Note that—Jonah’s three days in the fish are what Jesus refers to in predicting his time in the tomb. **Matthew 12:40**

**Micah – Last Book in this Portion of the Minor Prophets**

- Contemporary of Hosea and Isaiah.
- A prophet in Jerusalem during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah from 735 to 700 BC. Micah 1:1
- Messages to Samaria and Jerusalem the two capitals of the divided nation.
- Ministered through the time of Samaria’s destruction.

**Three messages in the book of Micah**

- Each begins with the call to *“listen”* to the word of the LORD. (Micah 1:2; 3:1; 6:1) Each begins with a condemnation of the sins of the nation and ends with a promise of restoration.
- *First Message*—directed to Samaria in graphic and powerful language: *“Look! The LORD is coming...the mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart.”* Micah 1:3–4
- The LORD will *“make Samaria a pile of rubble...and lay bare her foundations.”* Micah 1:6
- Prophet is moved by his own message and says: *“Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked...for her wound is incurable.”* Micah 1:8–9
- Message ends with hope, for the LORD says, *“I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel.”* Micah 2:12
- *Second Message*—strongest language about the future destruction of Jerusalem: *“Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the Temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.”* Micah 3:12
- This message has the wonderful prophecy of the birthplace of Jesus. *“But you, Bethlehem...though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, even from days of eternity.”* **Micah 5:2**
- *Third/Last Message*—Like a case presented in court: *“Stand up, plead your case before the mountains...the LORD has a case against his people.”* **Micah 6:1–2**
- Wonderful challenge: *“He has shown you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”* **Micah 6:8**

**Micah’s Final Words Offer the Greatest Hope for Sinners**

- *“Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.”* **Micah 7:18–19**

**Review**

- The first six Minor Prophets.
- All of them spoke the Word of the LORD in the times leading up to and including the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel.
- Only Hosea lived in Israel – His marriage was his lifelong message.
- Exact times of the ministries of Joel and Obadiah – not certain.
- Joel saw the LORD’s judgment of Zion in a plague of locusts and saw future final judgment of the nations.
- Through Obadiah, the LORD condemned Edom for their lack of pity for their relatives, the Jews.
- Amos was called from tending sheep in Judah to pronounce wrath against the calf-idols of Samaria.
- Jonah prophesied the fall of Nineveh and was angry when God showed compassion.
- Micah predicted the LORD’s judgment and restoration of Israel and Judah.
- Each prophet was called by God and their words and lives pointed to Christ.
