## Glossary

**Aaron** – Moses’ brother who was made his spokesman by God. Went with Moses to Pharaoh demanding children of Israel’s release from slavery. Made Israel’s first high priest. Was not allowed to enter the Promised Land.

**Abel** – Adam and Eve’s second son. Murdered by his jealous older brother Cain. Had faith in God (**Hebrews 11**) and was called righteous by Jesus (**Matthew 23:35**).

**Abraham** – Originally named Abram. Left home in Ur to go to Promised Land. Faith tested when asked to sacrifice son Isaac. Promised by God he would be father of many nations and kings. Called father of the faithful (**Romans 4:16**).

**Absalom** – King David’s son who attempted to take over the throne. While fleeing after losing a battle with David’s army he was caught in a tree and killed by Joab.

**Acrostic** – Understood as a short poem in which the first letters of the lines form a word, or name, or sentence.

**Ammonites** – Israel’s neighbors east of the Jordan River. The Ammonites are the *“sons of Ammon,”* who in **Genesis 19** were the offspring of Lot by one of his daughters. Their name is preserved in the modern city of Amman, Jordan.

**Angel** – A word of Greek origin originally meaning messenger. These are supernatural beings sent by God to humans.

**Anthropomorphic (anthropomorphism)** – The attribution of human characteristics to a nonhuman being.

**Apocrypha** – *“Apocrypha”* comes from the Greek word *apokrypha*, which means *“things that are hidden, secret.”* *“The Apocrypha”* refers to two collections of ancient Jewish and Christian writings that have certain affinities with the various books of the Old Testament and New Testament, but were not canonized by Christians as a whole: the Old Testament Apocrypha, which are still viewed as canonical by some Christians, and the New Testament Apocrypha, which are not.

**Apodictic Law** – Type of law characterized by absolute or general commands or prohibitions, as in the Ten Commandments. It is often contrasted with casuistic law.

**Aramaic** – The Semitic language which was the vernacular in Palestine in the time of Christ, and which He Himself almost certainly used.

**Ark of the Covenant** – The religious symbol of the premonarchic confederation of the twelve tribes of Israel, later installed in the temple in Jerusalem by Solomon in the tenth century BC.

**Canon** – Denotes a collection or list of books accepted as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.

**Casuistic law** – Case law, often in the form of a conditional sentence, in which specific situations are addressed. It is often contrasted with apodictic law.

**Chiasm** – A writing style that uses a unique repetition pattern for clarification and/or emphasis. Chiasm is pronounced *ky’-az-um.* Often called the chiastic (*ky’-az-tic*) approach or the chiastic structure. Chiasms are structured in a repeating A-B-C … C-B-A pattern. A chiasm is a repetition of similar ideas in the reverse sequence.

**Confessions of Jeremiah** – Those parts of the book of Jeremiah in which he laments to God the difficulties he experienced as a prophet. The confessions are in **Jeremiah 11:18–12:4**, **15:10–21**, **17:14–18**, **18:18–23**, and **20:7–18**.

**Covenant** – A contract or agreement between two or more parties. Covenant is how God has chosen to communicate to us, to redeem us, and to guarantee us eternal life in Jesus. These truths, revealed in the Bible, are the basis of Christianity. The Bible is a covenant document. The Old and New Testaments are really Old and New Covenants. The word *“testament”* is Latin for Covenant.

**Cyrus the Great** – Considered first true king of the Persian empire. Conquered the Median Empire in 549 BC and the Babylonian empire in 539 BC. Issued decree to allow Jews to return to Jerusalem.

**Daniel** – A descendent of a noble Jewish family who was taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon when he conquered Judah. Was highly likely a eunuch. Became a chief advisor to the King and eventually was made third ruler of kingdom (**Daniel 5**). God gave him ability to interpret dreams. Survived being thrown in lion’s den (**Daniel 6**). Gave prophecies that foretold of future world empires leading up to the return of Christ.

**Darius I the Great** – Persian king who authorized the completion of rebuilding Jerusalem’s Temple. Work on the temple was completed in 516 BC.

**Elijah** – Prophet who warned and punished King Ahab for his sins. Raised widow’s son from the dead. Had confrontation with Israel’s false prophets which ended in their death. After fleeing death threats from Jezebel, was told to anoint two kings and make Elisha his successor. Chariot of fire miraculously takes him to a location away from Elisha.

**Elohim** – The Hebrew word for god or gods, which, although plural in form, is often used as a title for Yahweh and is translated God.

**Esau** – Also called Edom. Son of Isaac and older twin brother of Jacob. Sold his birthright for bowl of red soup (**Genesis 25:30–34**). Founder of the Edomites.
