**Begin video.**

**Review of the Previous Session**

- Overview of the book of Jeremiah, the weeping prophet. His ministry lasted over 50 years.
- He warned and pleaded with his people until they were removed from their devastated homeland.
- Jeremiah is a personal look at the heart of the prophet who lived out the LORD’s anguish over the waywardness of his people.
- He lived through the destruction of Jerusalem.
- Was exiled in Egypt with a people who would never return to their home.

**The Beginning of Ezekiel’s Ministry**

- Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeremiah, begin his ministry with the Jews in exile.
- Ezekiel 1 gives the time and location of Ezekiel’s ministry.
- *“In the thirtieth year”* **(Ezekiel 1:1)**, probably refers to the prophet’s age.
- The fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile **(Ezekiel 1:2)**, was near the middle of the reign of Judah’s last king, Zedekiah.
- Ezekiel was in the first group of captives taken to Babylon during King Jehoiachin’s reign, around 605 BC.
- This was the beginning of the 70-year captivity spoken of by Jeremiah.
- He is *“among the exiles by the Kebar River”* **(Ezekiel 1:1)**, near Tel Abib **(Ezekiel 3:15)**, southeast of Babylon.
- There he saw *“visions of God”* and *“the hand of the LORD was upon him”* **(Ezekiel 1:3)**, and he was *“overwhelmed.”* **Ezekiel 3:15**
- This vision the LORD gave is a *“Theophany”* and it overwhelms the prophet.
- It begins with four living creatures, each with four faces and four wings with an appearance like *“burning coals of fire.”* **Ezekiel 1:10–13**
- Next he sees wheels within wheels *“high and awesome”* and *“full of eyes.”* **Ezekiel 1:18**
- As the living creatures and the wheels moved in unison, he realized that *“the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.”* **Ezekiel 1:10–22**
- Finally, above the creatures was *“an expanse”* and *“a voice”* and *“above the expanse…a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.”* **Ezekiel 1:25–26**
- *“This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell face down, and I heard the voice of one speaking.”* **Ezekiel 1:28**
- The LORD speaks to Ezekiel and commissions him as a prophet *“to a rebellious nation.”* **Ezekiel 2:3**
- Ezekiel’s messages, like those of the prophets before him and after him, will go unheeded.
- The LORD tells him, *“The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn…and whether they listen or fail to listen…they will know that a prophet has been among them.”* **Ezekiel 2:4–5**
- God warns him not to be afraid of those to whom he is being sent: they are a *“rebellious house,”* **(Ezekiel 2:6)** but he must not be like them. **Ezekiel 2:8**
- The vision continues and Ezekiel sees a hand holding a scroll written on both sides with *“words of lament and mourning and woe.”* **Ezekiel 2:9–10**
- God tells him, *“Son of man, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel.”* **Ezekiel 3:1**
- Ezekiel obeys and says, echoing Jeremiah’s words in **Jeremiah 15:16**, *“So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.”* **Ezekiel 3:3**

**Ezekiel’s prophecy has two main divisions**

- First, chapters 1–32 – the message of the coming destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple.
- At this time, the captive Jews were hoping for a swift return to their land. False prophets even predicted this.
- In this first part, Jerusalem has not yet been destroyed.
- *In Chapters 8 through 11, the LORD shows Ezekiel a vision of the glory of God as he departs from the Temple.*
- Second, chapters 33–48, after Jerusalem and the Temple have been destroyed, the prophet’s vision is of a new Temple and there he sees the LORD returning to live among his people. **Ezekiel 43**

**Further Divisions of the Book**

- Chapter 3:22–Chapter 24, Ezekiel’s message is about the coming judgment on Jerusalem.
- Chapters 25–32, he pronounces the LORD’s judgment against the nations.
- Chapters 33–48 are divided into two parts:
    - Chapters 33–39, Ezekiel predicts Israel’s rescue and the destruction of the nations opposed to the people of God.
    - Chapters 40–48, the future of Israel and the building of a new Temple and a new division of the holy land.

**Ezekiel’s Early Ministry is Acted Out Symbolically**

- The LORD’s first instructions to the prophet, *“I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent…but when I speak to you, I will open your mouth…”* **Ezekiel 3:26–27**
- His first message, in Chapter 4, the LORD has him graphically act out the siege of Jerusalem.
- In Chapter 6, the prophecy against *“the mountains of Israel,”* is a powerful picture of the righteous wrath of God that will be poured out on the land and the rebellious Jews still living there.
- Next word from the LORD declares, *“The end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.”* (**Ezekiel 7:2**) There will be no more delay.

**Ezekiel’s Next Vision, Chapters 8–11**

- One year and two months after his call. **Ezekiel 8:1**
- He again sees a vision of the glory of the LORD. **Ezekiel 8:4**
- He is taken *“in visions of God…to Jerusalem.”* **Ezekiel 8:3**
- The LORD allows him to see deeply into the wicked practices within and around the Temple of God.
- He sees a mark put *“on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable practices”* in the city. **Ezekiel 9:4**
- All without the mark are to be killed.
- Next, the glory departs from Jerusalem:
    - First, God departs from *“the threshold of the gate of the LORD’s house.”* **Ezekiel 10:18**
    - Next, with a backward glance, he stops at *“the entrance to the east gate of the LORD’s house.”* **Ezekiel 10:19**
    - Finally, Ezekiel sees the glory of the LORD going *“up from within the city”* to the *“mountains east of it.”* **Ezekiel 11:23**
- The glory has departed.
- Varied messages following this extraordinary vision, from Chapters 12–19, continue to describe the coming judgment of Jerusalem.

**Ezekiel Begins His Final Messages**

- A year later, *“In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day.”* (**Ezekiel 20:1**) Ezekiel begins his final messages telling of the coming destruction of Jerusalem.
- Elders of Israel inquire of the prophet. His message is the same: Jerusalem is doomed.
- Chapter 21 identifies Babylon as the *“sword”* (**Ezekiel 21:19**), God will use to judge Jerusalem.
- Chapters 22–24 graphically describe the sins and the coming judgment.
- A final tragic picture of the death of the hopes of the exiles is in Chapter 24 – Ezekiel’s wife dies and he is told not to mourn.
- Following this are messages of judgment against the nations of Ammon, Moab, Edom, the Philistines in Ezekiel 25; the city-state of Tyre and Sidon. **Ezekiel 26–28**
- This prophecy comes in the eleventh year. (**Ezekiel 26:1**) At the same time, Nebuchadnezzar is on his way to destroy Jerusalem.
- The future judgment against Egypt is the subject of Chapters 29–32.

**A Kind of “Re-Commissioning” for Ezekiel**

- Chapter 33 is almost a re-stating of Ezekiel’s responsibilities as a prophet from **Ezekiel 3:17–21**.
- The LORD reminds him, *“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.”* (**Ezekiel 33:7**) This is in preparation of the news that is soon to arrive.
- *“In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, ‘The city has fallen!’”* **Ezekiel 33:21**

**Ezekiel Speaks of a New Hope**

- After the fall of Jerusalem, the message takes on a different tone.
- Since there is no hope of returning to Jerusalem, he begins to speak of a new hope:
    - For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: *“I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.”* **Ezekiel 34:11–12**
- The LORD says in Chapter 36:27, *“I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.”*
- Chapter 37 is the wonderful prophecy of a valley of dry bones. The LORD asks Ezekiel, *“Son of man, can these bones live?”* **Ezekiel 37:3**
- Ezekiel speaks to them and they come alive. The LORD says to his people, *“I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land.”* **Ezekiel 37:14**
- Ezekiel 38–39 look far into the future. This message against *“Gog and Magog”* is taken up again in **Revelation 20**.

**Final Chapters of the Book of Ezekiel**

- Detailed plans for a new Temple and a new division of the Promised Land – as being far in the future. It is clear from Ezekiel’s first vision to the final glimpse of a glorious city named *“The LORD is there”* (**Ezekiel 48:35**), that Jesus is present with him.
- Jesus shows his view of sin through Ezekiel – it must be judged. In the New Testament, we see the Lord’s kindness and grace, but we also see that he will not ignore hypocrisy and evil.
- Ezekiel assures his people, longing for their homeland, that the LORD has something better in store. Their final home will not be tainted by sin.
- The Shepherd who will gather his scattered people, will first suffer the wrath of God against sin and usher in everlasting righteousness.

**Ezekiel as a Type of Christ**

- Seen in the name God calls him: *“son of man.”*
- This name for the prophet is used 87 times.
- Jesus calls himself this name over 80 times.
- Although he is born into the priesthood (**Ezekiel 1:3**), the name *“son of man”* identifies him with his people: he, too, is an exile.
- No Temple in which to minister; no place to offer sacrifice.
- Of all the names by which Jesus is known, he chose to call himself the *“Son of man,”* as he lived among us.
- In Jesus’ flesh, sin was judged once and for all.
- Everyone who believes in him will come to that city called *“The LORD is there.”*

**Review**

- A brief look at the great prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
- Isaiah’s ministry was in Jerusalem during the turmoil and destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel and the near-destruction of Jerusalem.
- About 100 years later contemporaries Jeremiah, in Jerusalem and Ezekiel near Babylon ministered as Jerusalem is destroyed.
- All three were faithful messengers to a people who refused to hear.
- Each one spoke of a judgment to come and a future hope.
- Through each one, the image of the Anointed One grew clearer.
- The One to whom *“the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing”* (**1 Peter 1:11**), was still far off.

**Preview of the Next Session**

- Last book of the section of the Tanakh called *“the Prophets,”* this is a book called *“The Twelve,”* a collection of what is also known as the Minor Prophets.
- Look at each book individually as to their place in Jewish history and learn the basic message of each book.
