### CDI Titus Chapters Summary

***In Titus, Paul*** writes to his trusted co-worker on the island of Crete to instruct him in appointing qualified elders and setting things in order in the churches (*1:5*). He emphasizes the need for godly leadership, sound doctrine, and Christlike behavior in all areas of life—within the church, in the home, and in society. Paul warns against false teachers and empty religious talk that undermines the truth of the gospel (*1:10–16*). He outlines what healthy teaching looks like for older men and women, younger believers, church leaders, and even slaves, all rooted in the grace of God that has appeared to bring salvation to all (*2:1–14*). The letter ends with reminders for believers to be ready for every good deed, live peaceably under authority, and avoid divisive arguments (*3:1–11*).
***Christ is presented as*** *our great God and Savior, who gave Himself to redeem and purify a people for His own possession* (*2:13–14*).
***Believers should*** *live godly lives, submit to authority, engage in good deeds, and adorn the doctrine of God in every respect* (*2:10; 3:1–8*).

## Titus Summary

## Chapter 1

### I. Introduction *(1:1–4)*

#### Salutation and Apostolic Purpose

**Salutation and Purpose**

> *Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
> in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,
> but at the proper time revealed His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted, according to the commandment of God our Savior;
> To Titus, my true son in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.*
> (*Titus 1:1–4, NASB1995*)

### II. The Importance of Godly Leadership in the Church *(1:5–16)*

#### A. Appointing Qualified Leaders *(1:5–9)*

**Qualifications of Elders**

> *For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,
> namely, if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of indecent behavior or rebellion.
> For the overseer must be blameless as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not overindulging in wine, not a bully, not greedy for money,
> but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined,
> holding firmly the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it.*
> (*Titus 1:5–9, NASB1995*)

#### B. Managing False Teachers *(1:10–16)*

**Rebuke of False Teachers**

> *For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
> who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not teach for the sake of dishonest gain.
> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”
> This testimony is true. For this reason reprimand them severely so that they may be sound in the faith,
> not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
> To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
> They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.*
> (*Titus 1:10–16, NASB1995*)

## Chapter 2

### III. The Importance of Godly Living in the Church *(2:1–15)*

#### A. Church Leaders *(2:1, 15)*

**Instructions for Sound Doctrine**

> *But as for you, proclaim the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.*
> (*Titus 2:1, NASB1995*)

#### B. Various Groups *(2:2–10)*

**Godly Living in All Stages of Life**

> Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.
> Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips, nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
> so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
> to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.
> Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;
> in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,
> sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.
> Urge slaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be pleasing, not argumentative,
> not stealing, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.
> (*Titus 2:2–10, NASB1995*)

#### C. All Believers *(2:11–14)*

**The Grace of God Has Appeared**

> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
> instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly manner in the present age,
> looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,
> who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, eager for good deeds.
> (*Titus 2:11–14, NASB1995*)

## Chapter 3

### IV. The Importance of Godly Living Outside the Church *(3:1–9)*

**Be Ready for Good Deeds**

> *Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,
> to slander no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing every consideration for all people.
> For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
> But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,
> He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we did in righteousness, but in accordance with His mercy,
> by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
> whom He richly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior,
> so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
> This statement is trustworthy; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently,
> so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people.
> But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the Law, for they are useless and worthless.*
> (*Titus 3:1–9, NASB1995*)

---

### V. Conclusion *(3:10–15)*

**Final Instructions and Greetings**

> *Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,
> knowing that such a person has deviated from what is right and is sinning, being self-condemned.
> When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
> Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.
> Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unproductive.
> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.
> Grace be with you all.*
> (*Titus 3:10–15, NASB1995*)
