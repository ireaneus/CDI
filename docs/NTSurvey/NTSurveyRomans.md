## I. Introduction vs.1:1-17

### **Romans Chapter 1**

**_In Chapter 1, Paul_** introduces himself as an apostle set apart for the gospel of God and emphasizes the gospel’s power to bring salvation to everyone who believes, both Jew and Gentile (_vv. 1–17_). He explains that God’s wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness because people suppress the truth and worship created things rather than the Creator (_vv. 18–23_). Paul describes how God gave them over to their sinful desires, resulting in moral corruption and various forms of wickedness (_vv. 24–32_). **_Christ is presented as_** _the Son of God, declared with power by His resurrection, through whom grace and apostleship are received_ (_vv. 3–5_), **_Believers should_** _live by faith and not be ashamed of the gospel, which is the power of God for salvation_ (_vv. 16–17_).

## II. The Sinfulness and Condemnation of All Men vs.1:18-3:20

**Romans Chapter 2**

**_In Chapter 2, Paul_** warns against judging others, reminding that God’s judgment is based on truth and applies to all, both Jews and Gentiles. He emphasizes that outward signs like circumcision are meaningless without obedience to God’s law and that true righteousness comes from a transformed heart (_vv. 1–29_). **_Christ is presented as_** _the righteous judge who judges impartially_ (_vv. 5–6_), **_Believers should_** _repent, seek God’s righteousness, and live with a transformed heart_ (_vv. 4, 13, 29_).

**Romans Chapter 3**

**_In Chapter 3, Paul_** explains that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin, emphasizing that no one is righteous by their own works (_vv. 9–20_). He declares that righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe, apart from the law, as all have sinned and fall short of God’s glory (_vv. 21–26_). Paul concludes that boasting is excluded because justification is by faith, not by works of the law (_vv. 27–31_). **_Christ is presented as_** _the one through whom God’s righteousness is revealed and believers are justified by faith_ (_vv. 22–26_), **_Believers should_** _trust in Christ for righteousness and understand that justification is by faith, not works_ (_vv. 22, 28_).

## III. The Justification of Believeing Sinners vs.3:21-5:21

**Romans Chapter 4**

**_In Chapter 4, Paul_** explains that Abraham was justified by faith before circumcision, making him the father of all who believe. He emphasizes that righteousness comes through faith, not the law, so the promise is based on grace (_vv. 1–22_). **_Christ is presented as_** _the one through whom justification and righteousness are given by faith_ (_vv. 24–25_), **_Believers should_** _have faith in God’s promises and trust in Christ, who was raised for their justification_ (_vv. 20–25_).
