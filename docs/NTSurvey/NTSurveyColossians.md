## Theme of Colossians *Survey of the New Testament*

The theme of Colssians is the deity and the all-sufficiency of Jesus Christ. In this letter, the apostle is showing the Colossian Christians that they were complete in Jesus Christ. They did not need anything else, in spite of the claims of the false teacher who was telling them that faith in Christ was not enough.

### The Doctrine of Jesus Christ

Jesus is the "image" of God, meaning that He is the exact reproduction of deity, lacking nothing. In other words, He is an exact manifestation of the unseen God.

**Firstborn of all creation**

The Greek word implied two things, *priority* to all creation and *sovereignty* over all creation. In the first meaning we see the absolute pre-existence of the Logos. Since our Lord existed before all created things, He must be uncreated... In the second meaning we see that He is the natural ruler, the acknowledged head of God's household... He is Lord of creation.

## Colossians Summary - Christ's Sufficiency and Supremacy

***In Colossians, Paul*** writes to affirm the sufficiency and supremacy of Jesus Christ in the face of false teachings that threatened the church.
***Christ is presented as*** *the image of the invisible God, the Creator and Sustainer of all things, the head of the church, and the fullness of deity in bodily form* (*1:15–20; 2:9–10*).
***Believers should*** *remain rooted in Christ, reject false teaching, and walk in holiness, knowing they are complete in Him* (*2:6–7; 3:1–17*).
