### **Philippians Paul's Personal Principles**

***In Philippians, Paul*** writes from prison to encourage the church in Philippi, expressing deep joy and gratitude for their partnership in the gospel (*1:3–5*). He rejoices that Christ is being preached and urges believers to live worthy of the gospel, standing firm and united (*1:18, 27*). He points to Christ’s humility as the model for believers—who, though God, emptied Himself and became obedient to death (*2:5–8*), calling the church to live in selfless service and shine as lights in the world (*2:14–16*). Paul warns against false teachers and presents his own life as an example of pressing on to know Christ and the power of His resurrection (*3:7–14*). He encourages peace, unity, and contentment, reminding them that God supplies every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus (*4:6–7, 19*).
***Christ is presented as*** *the humble and exalted Lord, the surpassing treasure, and the source of strength and provision* (*2:6–11; 3:8; 4:13, 19*).
***Believers should*** *rejoice always, imitate Christ’s humility, press on toward spiritual maturity, and stand firm in faith and unity* (*2:2–5; 3:13–17; 4:4*).
