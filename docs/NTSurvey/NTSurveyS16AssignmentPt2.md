## 2 John Summary

***In 2 John, the apostle*** writes to “the chosen lady and her children,” exhorting them to walk in truth and love, the commandments they have had from the beginning (*vv. 1–6*). He warns that many deceivers have gone out into the world, specifically those who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. Such a one is “the deceiver and the antichrist” (*v. 7*). Believers must guard themselves so that they do not lose what they have worked for but may receive a full reward (*v. 8*). Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son (*v. 9*). John instructs them not to receive false teachers into their homes or give them encouragement, lest they participate in their evil works (*vv. 10–11*). He ends with a brief hope of visiting them soon, that their joy may be made full (*vv. 12–13*).  
***Christ is presented as*** the incarnate Son whose true teaching must be preserved, the one in whom abiding brings fellowship with both the Father and the Son (*vv. 7, 9*).  
***Believers should*** walk in truth and love, guard against false teachers, abide in Christ’s doctrine, and refuse support to deceivers who deny the incarnation (*vv. 4–6, 8–11*).

### I. Greetings

**Walk According to His Commandments** *(1-13)*

> 1 The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,  
> 2 for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:  
> 3 Grace, mercy and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

### II. Exhortation to Obedient Love

> 4 I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father.  
> 5 Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.  
> 6 And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.  
> 7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.  

### III. Warning Against False Teachers

> 8 Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward.  
> 9 Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.  
> 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting;  
> 11 for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds.  

### Conclusion

> 12 Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your joy may be made full.  
> 13 The children of your chosen sister greet you.

## 3 John Summary

***In 3 John, the apostle*** commends Gaius for walking in the truth and showing hospitality to traveling brothers who preach the gospel (*vv. 1–8*). Gaius’s love and support make him a fellow worker with the truth. John contrasts this with Diotrephes, who refuses apostolic authority, speaks maliciously, rejects the brethren, and expels those who help them (*vv. 9–10*). John urges believers not to imitate what is evil but what is good, highlighting Demetrius as one who has a good testimony from all and from the truth itself (*v. 12*). John hopes to visit soon and speak face to face, closing with greetings from the brethren (*vv. 13–15*).  
***Christ is presented as*** the truth in whom believers walk, the basis for Christian fellowship, and the one whose teaching authenticates true ministry (*vv. 3–4, 8*).  
***Believers should*** support faithful ministers, imitate what is good, reject divisive and arrogant behavior, and walk in the truth with love and hospitality (*vv. 5–8, 11*).

### I. Commendation for Gaius

**You Walk in the Truth** *(1-15)*

> 1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.  
> 2 Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.  
> 3 For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.  
> 4 I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.  
> 5 Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers;  
> 6 and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.  
> 7 For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.  
> 8 Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth.

### II. Condemnation for Diotrephes

> 9 I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.  
> 10 For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church.  
> 11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.  

### III. Commendation for Demetrius

> 12 Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.

### IV. Conclusion

> 13 I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink;  
> 14 but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.  
> 15 Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.

## Class Exercise

Have your students read 2 and 3 John during class.  
**Ask the students to point out information about the readers, the problems faced by them, and any indicators of the relationship between John and the readers. This exercise should assists in interpretive reading.**  

Review the “Seven Churches” Nelson, Maps and Charts p. 451.  

**Discussion Questions:**  

- How could Gaius and this lady conceivably be connected with one of these churches and know John well?  
**They must have been leaders of some sort and suggest what their leadership role could have been.**  

- Describe the qualities of the lady in 2 John.  
**Things to note: chosen, mother, hospitable.**  

- Describe the qualities of Gaius in 3 John.  
**Things to note: beloved, witness, faithful.**  

- What is the problem dealt with in 2 John?  
**A kind of false teacher who denies that Jesus has come in the flesh.**  

- Is the problem external or internal to the church? Why?  
**It is an outside teaching masquerading as truth.**  

- What is the problem addressed in 3 John? Is it external or internal to the local church? Why?  
**Control of the church is at issue. Explore why this is a problem for churches in any age.**  

- Identify the ethical demands they both deal with for each letter.  
**Both are the ethics of hospitality and leadership.**  

State how the church today should apply these teachings.  
**This would expand the discussion. Use your own examples. The larger a church gets, the more impersonal it gets, and the less hospitality is practiced so churches should create opportunities for fellowship and teach hospitality. When it comes to leadership the church should extend an enthusiastic welcome for those who teach and serve the truth but beware of those who, though in ministry, are not teachers of truth. The church should also look for servant-leaders not charismatic personality types to stand before the congregation. Self-serving or self-aggrandizing leadership is anathema to the local church. Church leadership that is a personality cult or controlling is to be avoided.**
