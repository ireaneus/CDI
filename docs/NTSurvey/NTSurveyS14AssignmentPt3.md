### Theme of Hebrews

The main theme of Hebrews is the superiority of Jesus Christ. Hebrews emphasizes that Christianity (The New Covenant) is better than the old system in every way. Therefore, the New Covenant, and not the old, is to be the basis for the life of the believer.

## Hebrews Summary

The writer of Hebrews was not writing to an anonymous group of people scattered everywhere, but rather to people that he knew well.

**Seven serious warnings**  
These warnings are not essential to the argument of the book, they are important to an interpretation of the book.

> **2:1** *For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.*  
> **3:7-8** *Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,*  
> *“Today if you hear His voice,*  
> *Do not harden your hearts as when they provoked Me,*  
> *As in the day of trial in the wilderness,"*  
> **4:13** *And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.*  
> **5:11** *Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.*  
> **6:20** *where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.*  
> **10:26-27** *For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27but a terrifying expectation of judgment*  
> **10:29** *How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?*  
> **10:36** *For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.*  
> **12:15-16** *See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled; that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.*  
> **12:29** *for our God is a consuming fire.*

### Hebrews Chapter 1

***In Chapter 1, the author of Hebrews*** opens by affirming that God, who previously spoke through the prophets, has now spoken through His Son, *"whom He appointed heir of all things and through whom He also made the world"* (*v. 2*). This Son is *"the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature, and He upholds all things by the word of His power."* After making *"purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high"* (*v. 3*). The remainder of the chapter contrasts the Son with the angels, making it clear that Christ is far superior to them. Various Old Testament passages are quoted to show that while angels are servants, the Son is enthroned, eternal, righteous, and worshiped:

- *“You are My Son, Today I have begotten You”* — Psalm 2:7 (quoted in v. 5)  
- *“I will be a Father to Him and He shall be a Son to Me”* — 2 Samuel 7:14 (v. 5)  
- *“Let all the angels of God worship Him”* — Deuteronomy 32:43 LXX / Psalm 97:7 (v. 6)  
- *“Who makes His angels winds, and His ministers a flame of fire”* — Psalm 104:4 (v. 7)  
- *“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever”* — Psalm 45:6–7 (vv. 8–9)  
- *“You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth...”* — Psalm 102:25–27 (vv. 10–12)  
- *“Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”* — Psalm 110:1 (v. 13)  

***Christ is presented as*** the eternal, divine Son of God—the radiance of God’s glory and the exact imprint of His nature. He is the agent of creation, the sustainer of the universe, and the one who accomplished purification for sins. Christ is exalted at the right hand of God, superior to angels in both name and nature. He is addressed by God as *“My Son”* and is declared to be worshiped by the angels. His throne is eternal, His reign is righteous, and He is unchanging—unlike creation which will perish. The Father calls Him *“God”* and affirms His divine authority, eternal kingship, and creative power.  

***Believers should*** worship Christ as the exalted and eternal Son, listen to the word spoken through Him, and recognize His supremacy over all created beings (*vv. 1–6, 8–12*).

### Hebrews Chapter 2

***In Chapter 2, the author of Hebrews*** begins with a warning: *“For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it”* (*v. 1*). He emphasizes that the message spoken through angels was binding and that neglecting the great salvation announced by the Lord and confirmed by eyewitnesses is even more serious (*vv. 2–4*). The chapter explains that although Christ was temporarily made lower than the angels, it was in order to suffer death and bring many sons to glory. By doing so, He was perfected as the Author of salvation through suffering and fully identified with humanity in order to redeem them.

***Christ is presented as*** the incarnate Son who was made for a little while lower than the angels, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone (*v. 9*). He is the Author of salvation, made perfect through sufferings, and is not ashamed to call believers His brethren. A merciful and faithful High Priest, made like His brethren in all things.

***Believers should*** pay close attention to the message of salvation spoken through Christ, not neglect His word, and take comfort in His help as our faithful High Priest who understands our weakness (*vv. 1, 3, 17–18*).

### Hebrews Chapter 3

***In Chapter 3, the author of Hebrews*** calls his audience to consider Jesus as the *"Apostle and High Priest of their confession"*, who was faithful to God just as Moses was. However, Jesus is *"counted worthy of more glory than Moses"*—just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself (*vv. 1–6*). The author warns believers not to *"harden their hearts"*, quoting Psalm 95 to recall how Israel rebelled in the wilderness and failed to enter God’s rest (*vv. 7–19*).

- *“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as when they provoked Me”* — Psalm 95:7–8 (quoted in *Hebrews 3:7–8, 15*)
- *“They always go astray in their heart, and they did not know My ways”* — Psalm 95:10 (*Hebrews 3:10*)
- *“So I swore in My anger, ‘They certainly shall not enter My rest’”* — Psalm 95:11 (*Hebrews 3:11, 18*)

***Christ is presented as*** the *"faithful"* Son over God’s house, greater than Moses who was merely a servant within it (*vv. 1–6*). He is both the Apostle (sent one) and High Priest of our confession. Christ is the one and only *"Sabbath Rest"*.

***Believers should*** hold fast their confidence, and encourage one another daily so that none are hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Faithfulness, not mere association with the community, marks those who truly belong to Christ (*vv. 1, 6, 12–14*).

### Hebrews Chapter 4

***In Chapter 4, the author of Hebrews*** continues the theme of entering God's rest, urging believers to fear missing it due to disobedience and unbelief. The promise still stands, but just as Israel failed to enter because of hard hearts, so too can others fall short if they do not unite hearing with faith (*vv. 1–11*). The “rest” spoken of is not merely the land of Canaan but a future, spiritual rest foreshadowed in creation and now available in Christ. The chapter ends with a focus on the power of God's word and the compassionate role of Christ as High Priest (*vv. 12–16*).

- *“So I swore in My anger, ‘They certainly shall not enter My rest’”* — Psalm 95:11 (quoted in *Hebrews 4:3, 5*)
- *“And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”* — Genesis 2:2 (quoted in *Hebrews 4:4*)
- *“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* — Psalm 95:7–8 (quoted again in *Hebrews 4:7*)

***Christ is presented as*** the great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. He sympathizes with human weakness, having been tempted in all things yet without sin. He is the one through whom God’s rest is secured.

***Believers should*** strive to enter God’s rest through faith and obedience, remain soft-hearted to God’s voice, and come boldly to the throne of grace to receive mercy and help in time of need (*vv. 1, 11, 16*).

### Hebrews Chapter 5

***In Chapter 5, the author of Hebrews*** explains the qualifications of a high priest: appointed by God, able to deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, and offering sacrifices for sins, including his own. Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest but was appointed by God, as stated in Scripture. Though He was a Son, He learned obedience through what He suffered, and being made perfect, became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him (*vv. 1–10*). The chapter closes with a rebuke: the audience has become dull of hearing and immature in their understanding, needing milk rather than solid food (*vv. 11–14*).

- *“You are My Son, Today I have begotten You”* — Psalm 2:7 (quoted in *Hebrews 5:5*)
- *“You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek”* — Psalm 110:4 (quoted in *Hebrews 5:6, 10*)

***Christ is presented as*** the divinely appointed High Priest, not of the Levitical line, but of the order of Melchizedek. Though He is the eternal Son, He entered fully into human suffering and learned obedience through it. Through His perfect obedience, He became the source of eternal salvation. (*vv. 5–10*)

***Believers should*** grow in maturity, move beyond elementary truths, and become those who discern good and evil through constant use of God’s word (*vv. 11–14*).

### Hebrews Chapter 6

***In Chapter 6, the author of Hebrews*** urges believers to press on to maturity, moving beyond elementary teachings such as repentance, faith, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment (*vv. 1–3*). He delivers a serious warning about falling away after receiving the knowledge of the truth, stating that such apostasy makes repentance impossible and is akin to re-crucifying the Son of God (*vv. 4–6*). He illustrates this with land that either bears fruit or thorns, indicating blessing or cursing. However, he expresses hope for better things concerning his readers and reminds them that God is not unjust to forget their love and service (*vv. 7–10*). The chapter ends by pointing to God's promise to Abraham as a basis for hope, secured by two unchangeable things—God's promise and oath—anchored by Christ, our forerunner who has entered within the veil (*vv. 11–20*).

- *“Surely I will bless you and multiply you”* — Genesis 22:17 (quoted in *Hebrews 6:14*)
- *“The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind”* — alluded from Psalm 110:4 (contextual link to *Hebrews 6:20*)

***Christ is presented as*** the forerunner who has entered behind the veil on our behalf, becoming a High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. He is the anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, who secures the believer’s hope by His finished work and eternal priesthood (*vv. 19–20*).

***Believers should*** leave elementary teachings, pursue maturity, remain diligent in faith and love, and hold fast to the hope set before them, anchored in Christ (*vv. 1, 11–12, 18–19*).

### Hebrews Chapter 7

***In Chapter 7, the author of Hebrews*** explains the greatness of Melchizedek, the king of Salem and priest of God Most High, who met Abraham and blessed him after the victory over the kings. Abraham gave him a tenth of all, demonstrating Melchizedek’s superiority to Abraham himself (*vv. 1–4*). The author argues from the silence of Genesis—Melchizedek appears *“without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life”*—not literally, but in the way Scripture presents him, making him a fitting **type** of Christ (*v. 3*). Furthermore, since Levi descended from Abraham, even Levi “paid tithes” through Abraham, proving that Melchizedek’s priesthood is greater than the Levitical priesthood (*vv. 5–10*). The chapter then demonstrates that perfection could not come through the Levitical system, and therefore another priest “according to the order of Melchizedek” was necessary (*vv. 11–14*). This new priest arises not according to the Law of physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life (*v. 16*), confirmed by God’s oath in Psalm 110:4. The old commandment is set aside because it was weak and useless, and a better hope is introduced through which we draw near to God (*vv. 18–19*). Jesus, unlike mortal priests, continues forever and therefore holds His priesthood permanently (*vv. 23–24*). As the eternal High Priest, He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, since He ever lives to make intercession (*v. 25*). The chapter concludes by showing that Jesus is the perfect and holy High Priest we needed, appointed by God’s oath and exalted above the heavens (*vv. 26–28*).

**Old Testament Passages Referenced in Hebrews 7:**

- *“You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek”* — Psalm 110:4 (quoted in *Hebrews 7:17, 21*)
- *Genesis 14:18–20* — Melchizedek blessing Abraham and receiving the tithe (context for *Hebrews 7:1–10*)

**Precedence Principle Noted in Hebrews:**  
Just as Melchizedek appears suddenly in Genesis as a real historical man with no recorded genealogy, parents, birth, or death—and is known only by the brief account given—so also the author of Hebrews remains unnamed and without personal identification. The Holy Spirit presents both Melchizedek and the author in a deliberately anonymous manner. Melchizedek’s literary “silence” in Genesis becomes the basis for the typology used in Hebrews, and likewise, the Spirit-inspired anonymity of Hebrews elevates the message above the messenger. Remarkably, Hebrews contains the most extensive teaching on Melchizedek in all of Scripture—more than the entire Old Testament and New Testament combined—underscoring how God uses this deliberate anonymity to reveal the supremacy of Christ through the Melchizedek pattern.

***Christ is presented as*** the superior and eternal High Priest—greater than Abraham, greater than Levi, and greater than all the priests who came before. He is a priest *“according to the order of Melchizedek,”* not by genealogy but by divine appointment and the power of an indestructible life. He remains forever, holds His priesthood permanently, intercedes continually, and is the holy, innocent, undefiled High Priest who has been exalted above the heavens. His priesthood is secured by God’s oath, founded on perfect righteousness, and effective to save completely those who draw near to God through Him.

***Believers should*** draw near to God through Christ, trust in His continual intercession, and rest in the better hope and perfect priesthood that God has provided in His Son (*vv. 19, 22, 25*).

### Hebrews Chapter 8

***In Chapter 8, the author of Hebrews*** brings the argument to its central point: we now have a High Priest who is seated at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, serving in the true sanctuary—the heavenly tabernacle—which the Lord pitched, and not man (*vv. 1–2*). Earthly priests serve in a sanctuary that is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly reality. Moses was warned: *“See that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain”* (*v. 5*), establishing that the earthly tabernacle was modeled after a heavenly original (*vv. 6–7*). The chapter then quotes extensively from Jeremiah 31 (*vv. 8–12*). The chapter concludes by affirming that the first covenant is becoming obsolete and ready to disappear (*v. 13*).

- *“See that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain”* — Exodus 25:40 (quoted in *Hebrews 8:5*)
- *Jeremiah 31:31–34* — the New Covenant promise (quoted in *Hebrews 8:8–12*)

**Precedence Principle Noted in Hebrews:**  
Just as the earthly tabernacle was not an invention of Moses but a **copy, shadow, and reflection** of the true heavenly reality, so also the structure of God’s revelation in Hebrews operates by divine pattern. The earthly sanctuary took its design from a greater heavenly precedent; likewise, the earthly priesthood pointed to a greater heavenly High Priest. The author again deliberately emphasizes this principle: the heavenly reality precedes and defines the earthly copy. As Melchizedek precedes Levi, and as Christ precedes and surpasses all earthly mediators, so the heavenly tabernacle precedes the earthly one. God reveals truth through patterns—shadows first, substance later—and Hebrews 8 highlights this with unmistakable clarity.

***Christ is presented as*** the High Priest of the heavenly sanctuary, seated in authority at God’s right hand. Christ is the mediator of a better covenant. His priesthood and His covenant are superior, eternal, and divinely ordained.

***Believers should*** draw near to God through Christ as the mediator of the better covenant, trust in the full forgiveness He provides, and live under the reality of the heavenly sanctuary rather than the shadows of the earthly system (*vv. 6, 10–12*).

### Hebrews Chapter 9

***In Chapter 9, the author of Hebrews*** contrasts the earthly tabernacle—its structure, furnishings, and rituals—with the superior, heavenly ministry of Christ. The first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary (*vv. 1–5*). Priests entered the outer tabernacle continually, but only the high priest entered the Holy of Holies once a year, and *“not without taking blood”* (*vv. 6–7*). The Holy Spirit used this arrangement to show that the way into God’s presence was not yet open as long as the earthly tabernacle stood (*v. 8*). These rituals were symbolic, pointing forward to the time of reformation when Christ would come (*v. 10*). Christ entered not an earthly sanctuary but *“the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands”* (*v. 11*), and He did so *“not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood”* securing eternal redemption (*v. 12*). The blood of Christ cleanses the conscience in a way the old sacrifices never could (*vv. 13–14*). Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, but heaven itself, to appear in God’s presence on our behalf (*v. 24*). Unlike earthly priests who offer themselves repeatedly, Christ offered Himself once for all at the consummation of the ages to put away sin by His sacrifice (*vv. 25–26*). The chapter ends with the reminder that *“it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,”* and that Christ will appear a second time for salvation, not to deal with sin, but for those who eagerly await Him (*vv. 27–28*).

- *“See that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain”* — Exodus 25:40 (background to *Hebrews 9:1–5*)
- The Day of Atonement rituals — Leviticus 16 (context for *Hebrews 9:6–7*)
- *“Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness”* — Leviticus 17:11 (concept in *Hebrews 9:22*)

***Christ is presented as*** the High Priest of the greater and more perfect tabernacle in heaven. He is the mediator of the New Covenant. Exalted in heaven.

***Believers should*** rest in the complete forgiveness secured by Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice, draw near to God through His heavenly ministry, and eagerly await His return (*vv. 12, 14–15, 24, 28*).

### Hebrews Chapter 10

***In Chapter 10, the author of Hebrews*** contrasts the temporary and repetitive sacrifices of the Law with the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ (*v. 1*). Animal sacrifices were continually offered, yet they could not take away sins; instead, they served as a yearly reminder of them (*vv. 2–4*). Christ, however, came into the world saying, *“Behold, I have come to do Your will,”* fulfilling Psalm 40 and setting aside the first covenant to establish the second (*vv. 5–10*). By His offering of Himself once for all, believers are sanctified. Unlike priests who stand daily offering the same sacrifices, Christ offered one sacrifice for sins and then sat down at the right hand of God, waiting until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet (*vv. 11–13*). Through His single offering, He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified, as the Holy Spirit testifies in Jeremiah 31 that God will remember their sins no more (*vv. 14–18*).

- *“Sacrifice and offering You have not desired… Behold, I have come to do Your will”* — Psalm 40:6–8 (quoted in *Hebrews 10:5–7*)
- *“This is the covenant that I will make with them…”* — Jeremiah 31:33–34 (quoted in *Hebrews 10:16–17*)
- *“Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”* — Psalm 110:1 (echoed in *Hebrews 10:12–13*)

***Christ is presented as*** the obedient Son who came to accomplish the Father’s will, offering Himself once for all as the perfect and final sacrifice for sins. He sanctifies and perfects His people through His single offering, sits enthroned at God’s right hand, and inaugurates the New Covenant in which sins are fully forgiven and remembered no more.

***Believers should*** draw near with sincere hearts, hold fast their confession without wavering, meet together to encourage one another, and avoid the willful sin of rejecting Christ’s sacrifice (*vv. 19–25*). We are also urged to endure faithfully, knowing that the righteous one lives by faith and that Christ will come again (*vv. 35–39*).

### Hebrews Chapter 11

***In Chapter 11, the author of Hebrews*** defines faith as the certainty of what is hoped for and the conviction of things not seen (*v. 1*). By faith we understand that the *αἰῶνες* (“worlds,” “ages,” the entire created order) were framed by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from what is not visible (*v. 3*). The chapter then unfolds a sweeping record of Old Testament saints whose lives demonstrated faith—not as perfection, but as trusting obedience to God’s promises. Abel offered a better sacrifice, Enoch pleased God, Noah prepared an ark, Abraham obeyed and waited for the heavenly city, Sarah conceived beyond her ability, and many others embraced promises from afar (*vv. 4–12*). These all confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth, seeking a better country—a heavenly one (*vv. 13–16*). The examples continue with Abraham offering Isaac, Isaac blessing Jacob and Esau, Jacob blessing Joseph’s sons, Joseph speaking of the exodus, Moses’ parents hiding him, Moses identifying with the people of God, Israel crossing the Red Sea, and the fall of Jericho (*vv. 17–31*). The chapter concludes with a multitude of unnamed faithful believers who endured suffering, torture, imprisonment, and death, yet did not receive the fullness of the promise, because God had provided something better for us (*vv. 32–40*).

**Old Testament Passages Referenced in Hebrews 11:**  

- Creation by God’s word — Genesis 1:1–3 (*Hebrews 11:3*)  
- Abel’s sacrifice — Genesis 4:4 (*Hebrews 11:4*)  
- Enoch taken by God — Genesis 5:21–24 (*Hebrews 11:5*)

- Patriarchal blessings — Genesis 27, 48–50 (*Hebrews 11:20–22*)

- Red Sea — Exodus 14 (*Hebrews 11:29*)  
- Jericho — Joshua 6 (*Hebrews 11:30*)  
- Rahab — Joshua 2 (*Hebrews 11:31*)

**Precedence Principle Noted in Hebrews:**  
Chapter 11 uniquely highlights how God purposely records **some** names and leaves **many** unnamed. Just as Melchizedek was intentionally presented without genealogy to form a pattern that points to Christ, so here the Holy Spirit presents a long list of faithful people—some known, many anonymous—to emphasize not the fame of the individuals, but the nature of *faith* itself. Their anonymity is deliberate: the emphasis is on the pattern, not the personalities. This prepares the way for Hebrews 12, where the “cloud of witnesses” collectively directs attention away from themselves and onto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith. The literary anonymity in both Melchizedek **and** Hebrews 11 reinforces the precedence principle—shadows pointing forward, patterns preparing the way for Christ.

***Christ is presented as*** the ultimate fulfillment of faith’s focus, the one toward whom all the saints looked from afar. Though not mentioned by name in this chapter, Christ is the substance of the promises they embraced, the heavenly country they desired, and the better resurrection they hoped for. All previous examples of faith anticipate Him, and apart from Him they would not be made perfect (*v. 40*).

***Believers should*** live by faith in the unseen promises of God, endure hardship as strangers and exiles on the earth, and join the long line of those who trust God’s word even when the fulfillment is yet future (*vv. 1, 6, 13–16, 35–38*).

### Hebrews Chapter 12

***In Chapter 12, the author of Hebrews*** urges believers to run the race of faith with endurance by looking to Jesus, the *“author and perfecter of faith,”* who endured the cross and is now seated at the right hand of God (*vv. 1–2*). Believers are encouraged not to grow weary but to consider Him who endured hostility from sinners (*v. 3*). Their hardships are reframed as the loving discipline of a Father shaping His children for holiness (*vv. 4–11*). The author then calls them to strengthen weak hands and knees, pursue peace, and guard against bitterness or godlessness, using Esau as an example of one who despised his inheritance (*vv. 12–17*). A powerful contrast follows: they have not come to Sinai, the mountain of fear and judgment, but to Zion—the heavenly Jerusalem—where angels, the redeemed, and Jesus the mediator of a better covenant reside (*vv. 18–24*). The chapter ends with a solemn warning not to refuse God who speaks from heaven, for the coming shaking will remove all that is created so that the unshakable kingdom remains. Therefore believers should offer God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, *“for our God is a consuming fire”* (*vv. 25–29*).

**Old Testament Passages Referenced in Hebrews 12:**  

- *“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord”* — Proverbs 3:11–12 (*Hebrews 12:5–6*)  
- The wilderness generation — Numbers 14 (*Hebrews 12:3, 25*)  
- Esau’s rejection — Genesis 25:29–34; 27:30–38 (*Hebrews 12:16–17*)  
- The giving of the Law at Sinai — Exodus 19 (*Hebrews 12:18–21*)  
- *“Yet once more I will shake the heavens and the earth”* — Haggai 2:6 (*Hebrews 12:26*)  

**Precedence Principle Noted in Hebrews:**  
Hebrews 12 brings the anonymity of Chapter 11 to its intended climax. The “great cloud of witnesses” is presented not to draw attention to themselves but to turn all eyes toward Jesus. Their stories—some named, many unnamed—create a pattern of faith that **culminates**, not in human examples, but in the person of Christ. Just as Melchizedek’s intentional anonymity served to point beyond himself to a greater priesthood, and just as the unnamed faithful in Chapter 11 highlight the nature of faith rather than the fame of individuals, so Chapter 12 makes clear that the entire witness of Scripture exists to lead the believer to Jesus. Likewise, the contrast between Sinai and Zion functions by divine pattern: the terror and distance of Sinai precede the joy and access of Zion, revealing that the new covenant reality is the heavenly fulfillment of the old covenant shadow. The precedence principle is fully on display—shadows first, then substance; witnesses first, then the One to whom they all point.

***Christ is presented as*** the Author and Perfecter of faith, the one who for the joy set before Him endured the cross and is now enthroned at God’s right hand. He is the mediator of the new covenant whose sprinkled blood speaks better than the blood of Abel. Christ is the center of the heavenly assembly, the one who grants access to Mount Zion—the unshakable kingdom of God.

***Believers should*** fix their eyes on Jesus, endure discipline as sons, pursue peace and holiness, refuse bitterness and godlessness, listen to the God who speaks from heaven, and worship Him with reverence and awe (*vv. 1–2, 5–14, 25–29*).

### Hebrews Chapter 13

***In Chapter 13, the author of Hebrews*** concludes the letter with a series of practical exhortations for Christian living. Believers are urged to continue in brotherly love, show hospitality, remember prisoners, honor marriage, and keep themselves free from the love of money, trusting that God has said, *“I will never leave you nor forsake you”* (*vv. 1–6*). They are instructed to imitate the faith of their leaders and to remember that *“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever”* (*v. 8*). The author warns them not to be carried away by strange teachings, for their strength comes from grace, not ceremonial foods (*vv. 9–10*). He presents Christ as the one who suffered outside the camp, urging believers to follow Him in bearing reproach and seeking the city that is to come (*vv. 11–14*). Through Christ, they are to continually offer a sacrifice of praise, do good, and share with others (*vv. 15–16*). They are to obey and submit to their leaders, who keep watch over their souls (*v. 17*). The chapter—and the letter—closes with a beautiful benediction that highlights the God of peace who brought up Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant, equipping believers to do His will (*vv. 20–21*). Final greetings follow, affirming the unity of the church (*vv. 22–25*).

**Old Testament Allusions in Hebrews 13:**  

- *“I will never leave you nor forsake you”* — Deuteronomy 31:6, 8 (*Hebrews 13:5*)  
- The sacrificial system — Leviticus 4; 16 (*Hebrews 13:11–13*)  
- The “city to come” — echoes of Abraham’s hope in Genesis 12; 15 (connected to Hebrews 11)  

**Precedence Principle Noted in Hebrews:**  
The final chapter demonstrates how the entire epistle moves from **shadow to substance**, **pattern to fulfillment**, **earthly to heavenly**. The sacrificial system, the camp, the priestly rituals, and even the idea of wandering outside the camp all served as precedents pointing to Christ. Here, the author applies the principle directly to Christian living: because Jesus suffered “outside the camp,” believers must be willing to follow Him in rejection, bearing His reproach while seeking the lasting city God has prepared. Likewise, just as earlier generations were shepherded through the wilderness under God’s covenant, the believers now live under the *eternal covenant* established by Christ—the great Shepherd. The entire letter ends by showing that the precedents of Israel’s history find their fulfillment and clarity in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

***Christ is presented as*** the unchanging Lord—*“the same yesterday and today and forever”*—the great Shepherd of the sheep, raised by the God of peace through the blood of the eternal covenant. He suffered outside the gate to sanctify His people and now equips believers to do God’s will. He is the center of the Christian’s worship, obedience, and hope, the One through whom we offer continual praise.

***Believers should*** continue in love, hospitality, purity, contentment, and generosity; imitate godly leaders; bear the reproach of Christ; continually offer sacrifices of praise; do good and share; and submit joyfully to those who shepherd their souls (*vv. 1–17*).

## I. Christ's Superiority in Revelation

**God's Final Word in His Son** *(1:1-14)*

> 1 God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,  
> 2 in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.  
> 3 And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,  
> 4 having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.

## II. Christ's Superiority over Angels

> 5 For to which of the angels did He ever say,  
> *“You are My Son,*  
> *Today I have begotten You”?*  
> And again,  
> *“I will be a Father to Him*  
> *And He shall be a Son to Me”?*  
> 6 And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,  
> *“And let all the angels of God worship Him.”*  
> 7 And of the angels He says,  
> *“Who makes His angels winds,*  
> *And His ministers a flame of fire.”*  
> 8 But of the Son He says,  
> *“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,*  
> *And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.*  
> 9 *You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;*  
> *Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You*  
> *With the oil of gladness above Your companions.”*  
> 10 And, *“You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth,*  
> *And the heavens are the works of Your hands;*  
> 11 *They will perish, but You remain;*  
> *And they all will become old like a garment,*  
> 12 *And like a mantle You will roll them up;*  
> *Like a garment they will also be changed.*  
> *But You are the same,*  
> *And Your years will not come to an end.”*  
> 13 But to which of the angels has He ever said,  
> *“Sit at My right hand,*  
> *Until I make Your enemies*  
> *A footstool for Your feet”?*  
> 14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?

**Give Heed** *(2:1-4)*

> 1 For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.  
> 2 For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,  
> 3 how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,  
> 4 God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.

**Earth Subject to Man** *(2:5-8)*

> 5 For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking.  
> 6 But one has testified somewhere, saying,  
> *“What is man, that You remember him?*  
> *Or the son of man, that You are concerned about him?*  
> 7 *You have made him for a little while lower than the angels;*  
> *You have crowned him with glory and honor,*  
> *And have appointed him over the works of Your hands;*  
> 8 *You have put all things in subjection under his feet.”*  
> For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.

**Jesus Briefly Humbled** *(2:9-18)*

> 9 But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.  
> 10 For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.  
> 11 For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,  
> 12 saying, *“I will proclaim Your name to My brethren,*  
> *In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your praise.”*  
> 13 And again, *“I will put My trust in Him.”*  
> And again, *“Behold, I and the children whom God has given Me.”*  
> 14 Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,  
> 15 and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.  
> 16 For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.  
> 17 Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.  
> 18 For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.

## III. Christ's Superiority over Moses

**Jesus Our High Priest** *(3:1:11)*

> 1 Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;  
> 2 He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.  
> 3 For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.  
> 4 For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.  
> 5 Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;  
> 6 but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.  
> 7 Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,  
> *“Today if you hear His voice,*  
> 8 *Do not harden your hearts as when they provoked Me,*  
> *As in the day of trial in the wilderness,*  
> 9 *Where your fathers tried Me by testing Me,*  
> *And saw My works for forty years.*  
> 10 *Therefore I was angry with this generation,*  
> *And said, ‘They always go astray in their heart,*  
> *And they did not know My ways’;*  
> 11 *As I swore in My wrath,*  
> *‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ”*

**The Peril of Unbelief** *(3:12-19)*

> 12 Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.  
> 13 But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called *“Today,”* so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  
> 14 For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,  
> 15 while it is said,  
> *“Today if you hear His voice,*  
> *Do not harden your hearts, as when they provoked Me.”*  
> 16 For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?  
> 17 And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?  
> 18 And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?  
> 19 So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.

**The Believer's Rest** *(4:1-16)*

> 1 Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.  
> 2 For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.  
> 3 For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,  
> *“As I swore in My wrath,*  
> *They shall not enter My rest,”*  
> although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.  
> 4 For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: *“And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”*;  
> 5 and again in this passage, *“They shall not enter My rest.”*  
> 6 Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,  
> 7 He again fixes a certain day, *“Today,”* saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,  
> *“Today if you hear His voice,*  
> *Do not harden your hearts.”*  
> 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.  
> 9 So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.  
> 10 For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.  
> 11 Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.  
> 12 **For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.**  
> 13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.

## IV. Christ's Superiority over Aaron

> 14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.  
> 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  
> 16 Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

**The Perfect High Priest** *(5:1-14)*

> 1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;  
> 2 he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness;  
> 3 and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.  
> 4 And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.  
> 5 So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him,  
> *“You are My Son,*  
> *Today I have begotten You”;*  
> 6 just as He says also in another passage,  
> *“You are a priest forever*  
> *According to the order of Melchizedek.”*  
> 7 In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.  
> 8 Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.  
> 9 And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,  
> 10 being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.  
> 11 **Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.**  
> 12 **For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.**  
> 13 **For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.**  
> 14 **But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.**

**The Peril of Falling Away** *(6:1-8)*

> 1 Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,  
> 2 of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.  
> 3 And this we will do, if God permits.  
> 4 For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,  
> 5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,  
> 6 and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.  
> 7 For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;  
> 8 but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.

**Better Things for You** *(6:9-20)*

> 9 But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.  
> 10 For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.  
> 11 And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,  
> 12 so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  
> 13 For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,  
> 14 saying, *“I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.”*  
> 15 And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.  
> 16 For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute.  
> 17 In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,  
> 18 so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.  
> 19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,  
> 20 where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

**Melchizedek's Priesthood Like Christ's** *(7:1-28)*

> 1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,  
> 2 to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.  
> 3 Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.  
> 4 Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.  
> 5 And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.  
> 6 But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.  
> 7 But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.  
> 8 In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.  
> 9 And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,  
> 10 for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.  
> 11 Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?  
> 12 For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.  
> 13 For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.  
> 14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.  
> 15 And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,  
> 16 who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.  
> 17 For it is attested of Him,  
> *“You are a priest forever*  
> *According to the order of Melchizedek.”*  
> 18 For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness  
> 19 (for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.  
> 20 And inasmuch as it was not without an oath  
> 21 (for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,  
> *“The Lord has sworn*  
> *And will not change His mind,*  
> *‘You are a priest forever’ ”);*  
> 22 so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.  
> 23 The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,  
> 24 but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.  
> 25 Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.  
> 26 For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;  
> 27 who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.  
> 28 For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.

**A Better Ministry** *(8:1-6)*

> 1 Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,  
> 2 a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.  
> 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.  
> 4 Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;  
> 5 who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, *“See,”* He says, *“that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.”*  
> 6 But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.

**A New Covenant** *(8:7-13)* *(Jer. 31:31-34)*

> 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.  
> 8 For finding fault with them, He says,  
> *“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,*  
> *When I will effect a new covenant*  
> *With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;*  
> 9 *Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers*  
> *On the day when I took them by the hand*  
> *To lead them out of the land of Egypt;*
> *For they did not continue in My covenant,*  
> *And I did not care for them, says the Lord.*  
> 10 *For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel*  
> *After those days, says the Lord:*  
> *I will put My laws into their minds,*  
> *And I will write them on their hearts.*  
> *And I will be their God,*  
> *And they shall be My people.*  
> 11 *And they shall not teach everyone his fellow citizen,*  
> *And everyone his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’*  
> *For all will know Me,*  
> *From the least to the greatest of them.*  
> 12 *For I will be merciful to their iniquities,*  
> *And I will remember their sins no more.”*  
> 13 When He said, *“A new covenant,”* He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.

**The Old and the New** *(9:1-28)*

> 1 Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.  
> 2 For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.  
> 3 Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,  
> 4 having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;  
> 5 and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.  
> 6 Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,  
> 7 but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.  
> 8 The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,  
> 9 which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,  
> 10 since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.  
> 11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;  
> 12 and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.  
> 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,  
> 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  
> 15 For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.  
> 16 For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.  
> 17 For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.  
> 18 Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.  
> 19 For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,  
> 20 saying, *“This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you.”*  
> 21 And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.  
> 22 And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.  
> 23 Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  
> 24 For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;  
> 25 nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.  
> 26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.  
> 27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,  
> 28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him.

**One Sacrifice of Christ is Sufficient** *(10:1-18)* *(Psalm 40:6-8)*

> 1 For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.  
> 2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?  
> 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.  
> 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.  
> 5 Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,  
> *“Sacrifice and offering You have not desired,*  
> *But a body You have prepared for Me;*  
> 6 *In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have taken no pleasure.*  
> 7 *Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come*  
> *(In the scroll of the book it is written of Me)*  
> *To do Your will, O God.’ ”*  
> 8 After saying above, *“Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have not desired, nor have You taken pleasure in them”* (which are offered according to the Law),  
> 9 then He said, *“Behold, I have come to do Your will.”* He takes away the first in order to establish the second.  
> 10 By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  
> 11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;  
> 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,  
> 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet.  
> 14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.  
> 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,  
> 16 *“This is the covenant that I will make with them*  
> *After those days, says the Lord:*  
> *I will put My laws upon their heart,*  
> *And on their mind I will write them,”*  
> He then says,  
> 17 *“And their sins and their lawless deeds*  
> *I will remember no more.”*  
> 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin.

## V. Christ's Superiority over Self

**A New and Living Way** *(10:19-25)*

> 19 Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter *the holy place* by the blood of Jesus,  
> 20 by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,  
> 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,  
> 22 let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.  
> 23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;  
> 24 and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,  
> 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

**Christ or Judgement** *(10:26-39)*

> 26 For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,  
> 27 but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries.  
> 28 Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.  
> 29 How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?  
> 30 For we know Him who said, *“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay.”* And again, *“The Lord will judge His people.”*  
> 31 **It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.**  
> 32 But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,  
> 33 partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.  
> 34 For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.  
> 35 Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.  
> 36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.  
> 37 For yet in a very little while,  
> He who is coming will come, and will not delay.  
> 38 But My righteous one shall live by faith;  
> And if he shrinks back, My soul has no pleasure in him.  
> 39 But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.

**The Triumps of Faith** *(11:1-40)*

> 1 **Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.**  
> 2 For by it the men of old gained approval.  
> 3 By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.  
> 4 By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.  
> 5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.  
> 6 **And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.**  
> 7 By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.  
> 8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.  
> 9 By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;  
> 10 **for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.**  
> 11 By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.  
> 12 Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.  
> 13 All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.  
> 14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.  
> 15 And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.  
> 16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.  
> 17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;  
> 18 it was he to whom it was said, *“In Isaac your descendants shall be called.”*  
> 19 He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.  
> 20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come.  
> 21 By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.  
> 22 By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.  
> 23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.  
> 24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,  
> 25 choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,  
> 26 considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.  
> 27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.  
> 28 By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.  
> 29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.  
> 30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.  
> 31 By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.  
> 32 And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,  
> 33 who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,  
> 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.  
> 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection;  
> 36 and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.  
> 37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated  
> 38 (men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground  
> 39 And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,  
> 40 because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

**Jesus, the Example** *(12:1-3)*

> 1 Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,  
> 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  
> 3 For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

**A Father's Discipline** *(12:4-17)*

> 4 You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;  
> 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,  
> *“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,*  
> *Nor faint when you are reproved by Him;*  
> 6 *For those whom the Lord loves He disciplines,*  
> *And He scourges every son whom He receives.”*  
> 7 It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?  
> 8 But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.  
> 9 Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?  
> 10 For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.  
> 11 All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.  
> 12 Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,  
> 13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.  
> 14 Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.  
> 15 See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;  
> 16 that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.  
> 17 **For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.**

**Contrast of Sinai and Zion** *(12:18-24)*

> 18 For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,  
> 19 and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.  
> 20 For they could not bear the command, *“If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.”*  
> 21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, *“I am full of fear and trembling.”*  
> 22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,  
> 23 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,  
> 24 **and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.**

**The Unshaken Kingdom** *(12:25-29)*

> 25 See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.  
> 26 And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, *“Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.”*  
> 27 This expression, *“Yet once more,”* denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  
> 28 Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;  
> 29 **for our God is a consuming fire.**

## Conclusion

**The Changeless Christ** *(13:1-14)*

> 1 Let love of the brethren continue.  
> 2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.  
> 3 Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body.  
> 4 Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.  
> 5 Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, *“I will never desert you, nor will I ever forsake you,”*  
> 6 so that we confidently say,  
> *“The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.*  
> *What will man do to me?”*  
> 7 Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.  
> 8 **Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.**  
> 9 Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.  
> 10 We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.  
> 11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.  
> 12 Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.  
> 13 So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.  
> 14 For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.

**God-pleasing Sacrifices** *(13:15-19)*

> 15 Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.  
> 16 And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.  
> 17 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.  
> 18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.  
> 19 And I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.

**Benediction** *(13:20-25)*

> 20 Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord,  
> 21 equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.  
> 22 But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.  
> 23 Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.  
> 24 Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.  
> 25 Grace be with you all.

## Class Exercise

Review the verses in Hebrews that point to authorship and purpose. Emphasize the key verse. Go through the sections on characteristics and look up the examples of argument suspended for warning, *“let us,”* and Christology.  
*Have your students scan the text for *“let” or “let us.”* Here are some verses from the lecture: Heb. 2:1, 3:12, 4:1-9, 6:4-8, 10:26-36, 12:14-29, 13:13. Have your students identify what the write knew about the readers by looking up 5:11-6:12, 10:32; 12:4-5.*

**Discussion Questions:**  

What dimension of the person of Jesus Christ is developed in Hebrews? Examples?  
*The exalted person of Jesus, who is worthy of worship and through whom God yet communicates with His people, is the picture of Christ. Ask your students to find examples such as a priest after the order of Melchizedek.*

When you read through Heb. chapters 1 & 2 where do you see the Christmas story told in different terms?  
*Focus on 1:1-5 and 2:9ff.*

After reading Heb. 3 & 4 and other parts of the letter, what is the Christian understanding and practice of the Sabbath?  
*This is an observation question. However, it would be worthwhile to discuss church practices as a continuum  ranging from Adventists who meet on Saturday to those who honor no special day at all. Then lead a discussion on worship and ethical practices implied in the teaching of Hebrews on the Sabbath. Compare the outlines and ask to check their notes to get the author information, date, purpose, characteristics as well.*
