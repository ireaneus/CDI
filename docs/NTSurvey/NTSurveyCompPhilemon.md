## Philemon Summary - *Personal, Reconciliation*

***In Philemon, Paul*** writes a personal appeal on behalf of Onesimus, a runaway slave who had come to faith in Christ and was now useful both to Paul and to Philemon (*vv. 10–13*). Paul acknowledges Philemon’s love and faith and appeals for him to receive Onesimus not as a slave but as a beloved brother in Christ (*vv. 8–17*). He offers to repay any debt Onesimus owes and gently reminds Philemon of his own indebtedness to Paul (*vv. 18–19*). The letter emphasizes reconciliation, forgiveness, and the transforming power of the gospel in relationships.
***Christ is presented as*** *the mediator who transforms relationships and brings reconciliation between believers* (*vv. 15–16*).
***Believers should*** *forgive one another, welcome fellow believers as brothers, and reflect Christ’s love in all relationships* (*vv. 16–17*).
