## Key Verses

> **Gal. 5:1** It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.*  
> **1 Thess. 1:9-10** *For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.*  
> **2 Thess. 3:16-18** *Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all! I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.*  

## Class Discussion: General Letters

Review the glossary term Amanuensis.  
*Amanuensis -- A writer or secretary used to write the words of an Apostle or Biblical author. Peter wrote his first letter using an amanuensis. Look up 1 Peter 5:12.*

Highlight the definition of a general letter.  
*The definition of the General Epistles as sent to an unknown or indefinite audience. Discuss with the students how each seems to fit the definition.*

Find evidence of Peter’s distress in 2 Peter.  
*Here are a few possible verses and the distress they evidence 2 Peter 1:12 – 15. He talks about his coming martyrdom or 2 Peter 3:16 where he opens up some dispute about Paul’s letters.*

Look for the word “contenders” in Jude.
