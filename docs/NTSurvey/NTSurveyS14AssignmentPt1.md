*With your students, identify the changes in the status and conditions of the Jerusalem church between 33 and 70 AD. You may wish to list on a whiteboard the above scriptures under the following headings: Growing Influence, Controlling Influence, Declining Influence, and Needing Help.*

| Verses | Growing | Controlling | Declining | Needs help |

| Acts 6:7 | X | | | |
| Acts 8:4 | X | | | |
| Acts 15:6 | | | X | |
| Acts 24:17 | | | | X |

**Read Acts 4:5-22. With your students describe the attitude of unbelieving Jews toward the church.**  
*Encourage your students to use descriptors like foolish, ignorant, weak, etc.*

> Acts 4:5-22 The high priests, elders, were present and perplexed at what they saw *"A man of 40yrs - healed"*. They were ignorant of the Scriptures and foolish.

**Read Acts 10:14, 28, Acts 2:39, Romans 9:3-5, Acts 28:28 and describe the attitude of the larger church toward the believers of Jewish descent.**  
*The attitude ranged from positive to negative. It includes a view as separationist and legalistic to brethren and benefactors.*

> **Acts 10:14,28** But Peter said, “By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean.”, And he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.  
>
> **Acts2:39** "For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.”  
>
> **Romans 9:3-5** For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.  
>
> **Acts 28:28** Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen.”
