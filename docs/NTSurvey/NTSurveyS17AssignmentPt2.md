title: NTSurvey - Session 17 Part 2 - Revelation
date: 95 A.D
writer: John the Apostle
category: Prophetic
description: John wrote the Revelation in order to unite and complete the prophetic truth of the Bible. Without the book of Revelation there would be many unanswered questions about the end times. John also wrote to encourage the people of his day as they were enduring Roman persecution. They needed to know that persecution would never destroy God's church or God's purposes. This, of course, has continued to be an encouragement to persecuted believers throughout the ages.
