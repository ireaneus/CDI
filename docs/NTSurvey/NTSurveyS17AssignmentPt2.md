title: NTSurvey - Session 17 Part 2 - Revelation
date: 95 A.D
writer: John the Apostle
category: Prophetic
description: John wrote the Revelation in order to unite and complete the prophetic truth of the Bible. Without the book of Revelation there would be many unanswered questions about the end times. John also wrote to encourage the people of his day as they were enduring Roman persecution. They needed to know that persecution would never destroy God's church or God's purposes. This, of course, has continued to be an encouragement to persecuted believers throughout the ages.

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.351)*

Hermeneutic

- Literal
- But what about symbols?
- *“symbol is a timeless figurative representation”* Bernard Ramm, Protestant

Biblical Interpretation, W.A. Wilde: Boston, 1956.

- Interpret by scripture, context, nature, cross reference
- Beware double imagery
- Rev. 6:5ff, Rev. 6:12ff *“like”* or *“as”* simile
- Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 273, *“The very first interpretive principle is that Revelation must be approached literally.”*
- Never spiritualized. He quotes Ryrie, *“The difference between the literalist and the spiritualizer is simply that the former sees the symbols as conveying a plain meaning.”*

Approaches

- Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 272
- Allegorical
- Historical
- Futuristic

Allegorical

- Denies literal meaning
- Finds message couched in figurative terms to which interpreter assigns meaning
- Problem: the assigned meanings are arbitrary

Historical Approach

- All events are historical
- All events, save perhaps chapters 21-22, fulfilled in first century
- Problems
  - Late date of the Revelation makes it not prophetic but a report
  - Which events of the first century are assigned subjectively since it is in figurative language

Futurist Approach

- The events of chapters 4-22 are future
- These future events are literal, historical events
- The symbolic language describes these events if accurately understood

Interpretation

- Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 275 chart on development of the book
- Opening of 7th seal - opens 7 trumpets
- Sounding of 7th trumpet, 10:7, 11:15
- Opens 7 bowls (same as 7 plagues)
- Note the qualitative difference
- Interludes ch 7, 10:1-14:20, 15:1ff
- Babylon in 16:19 is the subject of 17
- Churches are real Asian churches
- Problems are typical of churches through the ages
- Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 276, *“selected because they represented churches of all times”*
- Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 279, see chart on chronology of Revelation
- Millennialism view: 3.5 years seals, 3.5 years trumpets and bowls followed by 1,000 year reign of Christ
- Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 274, *“Revelation is basically chronological”*
- See topics by chapters (chart p. 274)
- Old Testament background
  - Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Zechariah
- New Testament background
  - Matthew, Romans, 1 & 2 Thessalonians

### Theme of Revelation

John writes about the great end-time events that will occur during the Day of the Lord. The focus of this book is on the seven-year Tribulation, but also includes information about the second coming of Christ and about His millennial kingdom, which will be established on this earth. The great prophetic themes of the Bible are dealt with in this book.

## Revelation 4-22 Summary

### IV. "The Things Which Shall be Hereafter" The Program of Christ

**Scene in Heaven** *(4:1-4)*

> 1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, **“Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.”**  
> 2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne.  
> 3 And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.  
> 4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.

**The Throne and Worship of the Creator** *(4:5-11)*

> 5 Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;  
> 6 and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.  
> 7 The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.  
> 8 And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say,  
> *“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.”*  
> 9 And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,  
> 10 the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,  
> 11 *“Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.”*

**Chapter 4 Summary**

***In Chapter 4, John*** is taken up in the Spirit into heaven and sees a throne with One seated upon it, surrounded by twenty-four elders, flashes of lightning, seven lamps of fire (the seven spirits of God), and four living creatures who continually declare God’s holiness (*vv. 1–8*). The elders fall before the throne, cast their crowns, and proclaim God’s worthiness as Creator, for all things exist by His will (*vv. 9–11*).

***Christ is presented as*** the eternal, holy Lord God Almighty who receives unceasing worship on the throne and is honored as Creator (*vv. 8–11*).

***Believers should*** worship God with reverence, acknowledge His sovereignty, and honor Him as Creator (*vv. 10–11*).

## Revelation 5

**The Book with Seven Seals** *(5:1-10)*

> 1 I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.  
> 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, *“Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?”*  
> 3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.  
> 4 Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it;  
> 5 and one of the elders said to me, *“Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals.”*  
> 6 And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.  
> 7 And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.  
> 8 When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.  
> 9 And they sang a new song, saying,  
> *“Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.*  
> 10 *You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.”*

**Angels Exalt the Lamb** *(5:11-14)*

> 11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,  
> 12 saying with a loud voice,  
> *“Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.”*  
> 13 And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying,  
> *“To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.”*  
> 14 And the four living creatures kept saying, *“Amen.”* And the elders fell down and worshiped.

**Chapter 5 Summary**

***In Chapter 5, John*** sees a scroll in the right hand of the One on the throne that no one is worthy to open until the Lion of Judah—the Lamb who was slain—appears and takes the scroll (*vv. 1–7*). The living creatures, elders, angels, and every creature worship the Lamb, declaring Him worthy because He was slain and purchased people for God with His blood (*vv. 8–14*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lion of Judah and the slain yet victorious Lamb who alone is worthy to open the scroll and receives universal worship (*vv. 5–12*).

***Believers should*** worship Christ as the worthy Lamb and trust in His redemptive authority (*vv. 8–14*).

**The First Seal-Rider on White Horse** *(6:1-2)*

> 1 Then I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, *“Come.”*  
> 2 I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.

**The Second Seal-War** *(6:3-4)*

> 3 When He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, *“Come.”*  
> 4 And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.

**The Third Seal-Famine** *(6:5-6)*

> 5 When He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, *“Come.”* I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.  
> 6 And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, *“A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine.”*

**The Fourth Seal-Death** *(6:7-8)*

> 7 When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, *“Come.”*  
> 8 I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.

**The Fifth Seal-Martyrs** *(6:9-11)*

> 9 When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;  
> 10 and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, *“How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”*  
> 11 And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also.

**The Sixth Seal-Terror** *(6:12-17)*

> 12 I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;  
> 13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.  
> 14 The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.  
> 15 Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;  
> 16 and they said to the mountains and to the rocks, *“Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;*  
> 17 *for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”*

**Revelation 6 Summary**

***In Chapter 6, John*** witnesses the Lamb opening the first six seals of the scroll. The first four seals release four horsemen bringing conquest, war, famine, and death (*vv. 1–8*). The fifth seal reveals the martyrs beneath the altar crying out for God’s justice (*vv. 9–11*). The sixth seal brings cosmic disturbances—earthquake, darkened sun, blood-red moon, falling stars—and the people of the earth hide in fear from the wrath of the Lamb (*vv. 12–17*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb who opens the seals and initiates God’s judgments, exercising sovereign authority over history and its unfolding events (*vv. 1, 16–17*).

***Believers should*** trust in Christ’s sovereign justice and remain steadfast, like the martyrs, as God works out His purposes in the world (*vv. 9–11*).

**An Interlude** *(7:1-3)*

> 1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.  
> 2 And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,  
> 3 saying, *“Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads.”*

**The 144,000** *(7:4-8)*

> 4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:  
> 5 from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,  
> 6 from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,  
> 7 from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,  
> 8 from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.

**A Multitude from the Tribulation** *(7:9-17)*

> 9 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands;  
> 10 and they cry out with a loud voice, saying,  
> *“Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”*  
> 11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,  
> 12 saying,  
> *“Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”*  
> 13 Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, *“These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?”*  
> 14 I said to him, *“My lord, you know.”* And he said to me, *“These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.*  
> 15 *For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.*  
> 16 *They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat;*  
> 17 *for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”*

**Revelation Chapter 7 Summary**

***In Chapter 7, John*** sees four angels holding back the winds of judgment until the servants of God are sealed on their foreheads. One hundred forty-four thousand from the tribes of Israel are sealed (*vv. 1–8*). John then sees a great multitude from every nation standing before the throne and the Lamb, clothed in white robes and worshiping God (*vv. 9–12*). He learns that these are those who came out of the great tribulation, whose robes were washed white in the blood of the Lamb. They now serve God continually, and He shelters them, wiping away every tear (*vv. 13–17*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb who redeems a countless multitude, washes them in His blood, and shepherds them in God’s presence forever (*vv. 10, 14, 17*).

***Believers should*** worship God and the Lamb, trust in His protection and redemption, and remain faithful through tribulation (*vv. 10–12, 14*).

**The Seventh Seal-the Trumpets** *(8:1-13)*

> 1 When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.  
> 2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.  
> 3 Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.  
> 4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.  
> 5 Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.  
> 6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.  
> 7 **The first sounded**, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.  
> 8 The **second angel sounded**, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,  
> 9 and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.  
> 10 The **third angel sounded**, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters.  
> 11 The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.  
> 12 The **fourth angel sounded**, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.  
> 13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, *“Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”*

**Revelation Chapter 8 Summary**

***In Chapter 8, John*** sees the Lamb open the seventh seal, resulting in silence in heaven for about half an hour (*v. 1*). Seven angels are given seven trumpets, and another angel offers incense with the prayers of the saints before God. The angel then casts fire from the altar to the earth, signaling coming judgment (*vv. 2–5*). As the first four trumpets sound, catastrophic judgments strike the earth: vegetation is burned, the sea becomes blood, freshwater sources become bitter, and celestial light is darkened (*vv. 6–13*). An eagle then warns that worse judgments are yet to come.

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb whose opening of the final seal initiates the trumpet judgments and whose authority directs the unfolding of God’s purposes (*v. 1*).

***Believers should*** recognize the seriousness of God’s coming judgments, persevere in prayer, and live with reverence before the God who answers the cries of His saints (*vv. 3–5*).

**The Fifth Trumpet-the Bottomless Pit** *(9:1-12)*

> 1 Then the **fifth angel sounded**, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.  
> 2 He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.  
> 3 Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.  
> 4 They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.  
> 5 And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.  
> 6 And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them  
> 7 The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.  
> 8 They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.  
> 9 They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle.  
> 10 They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months.  
> 11 They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.  
> 12 The **first woe is past**; behold, **two woes are still coming after these things.**

**The Sixth Trumpet-Army from the East** *(9:13-21)*

> 13 Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,  
> 14 one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, *“Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”*  
> 15 And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind.  
> 16 The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.  
> 17 And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.  
> 18 A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.  
> 19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.  
> 20 The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;  
> 21 and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.

***In Chapter 9, John*** witnesses the sounding of the fifth and sixth trumpets. The fifth trumpet releases demonic torment from the abyss as locust-like beings led by Abaddon/Apollyon afflict those without God’s seal for five months (*vv. 1–11*). The sixth trumpet releases four bound angels at the Euphrates who lead an enormous cavalry force that kills a third of mankind through plagues of fire, smoke, and brimstone (*vv. 13–19*). Despite these judgments, the rest of humanity refuses to repent of idolatry, murder, sorcery, immorality, and theft (*vv. 20–21*).

***Christ is presented as*** the sovereign Lord who permits and controls these trumpet judgments as part of God’s unfolding wrath (*vv. 1, 13*).

***Believers should*** recognize the justice of God’s judgments and maintain faithful repentance and obedience, unlike those who harden their hearts (*vv. 20–21*).

## Revelation 10

**The Angel and the Little Book** *(10:1-11)*

> 1 I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;  
> 2 and he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;  
> 3 and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.  
> 4 When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, *“Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.”*  
> 5 Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,  
> 6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there will be delay no longer,  
> 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets.  
> 8 Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, *“Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.”*  
> 9 So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he said to me, *“Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”*  
> 10 I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.  
> 11 And they said to me, *“You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”*

**Revelation 10 Summary**

***In Chapter 10, John*** sees a mighty angel descending from heaven, clothed with a cloud, a rainbow on his head, and his face shining like the sun. He holds a little scroll open in his hand and stands with one foot on the sea and one on the land, declaring that when the seventh trumpet sounds, the mystery of God will be completed as He announced to His prophets (*vv. 1–7*). John is then told to take the little scroll and eat it; it is sweet in his mouth but bitter in his stomach. He is instructed that he must prophesy again concerning many peoples, nations, languages, and kings (*vv. 8–11*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lord whose purposes are nearing fulfillment, the one whose mystery will be completed at the sound of the seventh trumpet (*v. 7*).

***Believers should*** receive and proclaim God’s word faithfully, recognizing that His revelation may be both sweet and bitter as His purposes unfold (*vv. 9–11*).

**The Two Witnesses** *(11:1-14)*

> 1 Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, *“Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it.*  
> 2 *Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months.*  
> 3 *And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”*  
> 4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.  
> 5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.  
> 6 These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.  
> 7 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them.  
> 8 And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.  
> 9 Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.  
> 10 And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.  
> 11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them.  
> 12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, *“Come up here.”* Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them.  
> 13 And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.  
> 14 The **second woe is past**; behold, the **third woe is coming quickly.**

**The Seventh Trumpet-Christ's Reign Foreseen third woe** *(11:15-19)*

> 15 Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,  
> *“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”*  
> 16 And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,  
> 17 saying,  
> *“We give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who were, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.*  
> 18 *And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”*  
> 19 And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.

**Revelation 11 Summary**

***In Chapter 11, John*** is given a measuring rod and told to measure the temple, the altar, and those who worship there, while the outer court is left to the nations who will trample the holy city for forty-two months (*vv. 1–2*). God’s two witnesses prophesy for 1,260 days with power to strike the earth with plagues, shut the sky, and consume enemies with fire (*vv. 3–6*). When their testimony is complete, the beast kills them, and their bodies lie in the great city. After three and a half days, God raises them, and they ascend to heaven, causing fear and a great earthquake (*vv. 7–13*). The seventh trumpet sounds, and loud voices in heaven proclaim that the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ. The elders worship God as He begins to reign and prepares to judge the dead and reward His servants (*vv. 14–19*).

***Christ is presented as*** the one whose kingdom overtakes the kingdoms of the world, who reigns forever and ever, and who rewards His servants and brings judgment (*vv. 15–18*).

***Believers should*** remain faithful in witness, trust God’s sovereign timing, and worship Him as the rightful King whose rule will be fully revealed (*vv. 3, 11, 15–18*).

**The Woman, Israel** *(12:1-2)*

> 1 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;  
> 2 and she was with child; and she cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.

**The Red Dragon, Satan** *(12:3-4)*

> 3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.  
> 4 And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.

**The Male Child, Christ** *(12:5-6)*

> 5 And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.  
> 6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.

**The Angel, Michael** *(12:7-17)*

> 7 And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,  
> 8 and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.  
> 9 And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.  
> 10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,  
> *“Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.*  
> 11 *And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death.*  
> 12 *For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.”*  
> 13 And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.  
> 14 But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.  
> 15 And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.  
> 16 But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth.  
> 17 So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

**Revelation 12 Summary**

***In Chapter 12, John*** sees a great sign in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun who gives birth to a male child destined to rule all nations, while a great red dragon seeks to devour the child (*vv. 1–4*). The child is caught up to God and His throne, and the woman flees into the wilderness where God protects her for 1,260 days (*vv. 5–6*). A war in heaven occurs—Michael and his angels fight the dragon, who is cast down to earth with his angels (*vv. 7–9*). A loud voice declares victory through the blood of the Lamb and the word of believers’ testimony (*vv. 10–11*). Enraged, the dragon persecutes the woman and her offspring—those who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus (*vv. 13–17*).

***Christ is presented as*** the male child who is destined to rule all nations and is exalted to God’s throne, securing victory over the dragon through His redemptive work (*vv. 5, 10–11*).

***Believers should*** overcome through the blood of the Lamb and their testimony, remain faithful under persecution, and keep God’s commandments (*vv. 11, 17*).

**the Beast from the Sea** *(13:1-10)*

> 1 And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.  
> Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.  
> 2 And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.  
> 3 I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast;  
> 4 they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, *“Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?”*  
> 5 There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.  
> 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.  
> 7 It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.  
> 8 All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.  
> 9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.  
> 10 If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.

**The Beast from the Earth** *(13:11-18)*

> 11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.  
> 12 He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.  
> 13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men.  
> 14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life.  
> 15 And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.  
> 16 And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,  
> 17 and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.  
> 18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

**Revelation 13 Summary**

***In Chapter 13, John*** sees a beast rising out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads, receiving power, throne, and authority from the dragon. The world marvels and worships the beast, who speaks blasphemies and makes war with the saints for forty-two months (*vv. 1–8*). A second beast rises from the earth, performing signs and directing the world to worship the first beast. He creates an image of the beast, causes those who refuse to worship it to be killed, and enforces a mark on all people so that no one can buy or sell without it (*vv. 11–17*). The chapter closes with the famous call for wisdom: the number of the beast is 666 (*v. 18*).

***Christ is presented as*** the one whose true authority stands in contrast to the counterfeit power of the beasts, and whose people remain written in the book of life of the Lamb slain (*vv. 8*).

***Believers should*** demonstrate endurance and faithfulness, resist deception and coerced worship, and remain loyal to Christ despite pressure or persecution (*vv. 10, 18*).

**The Lamb and the 144,000 on Mount Zion** *(14:1-5)*

> 1 Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.  
> 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.  
> 3 And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.  
> 4 These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.  
> 5 And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.

**Vision of the Angel with the Gospel** *(14:6-8)*

> 6 And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;  
> 7 and he said with a loud voice, *“Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.”*  
> 8 And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, *“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality.”*

**Doom for Worshipers of the Beast** *(14:9-13)*

> 9 Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, *“If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,*  
> 10 *he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.*  
> 11 *And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”*  
> 12 Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.  
> 13 And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, *“Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!’ ”* *“Yes,”* says the Spirit, *“so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them.”*

**The Reapers** *(14:14-20)*

> 14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.  
> 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, *“Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.”*  
> 16 Then He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.  
> 17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.  
> 18 Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, *“Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.”*  
> 19 So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.  
> 20 And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles.

**Revelation 14 Summary**

***In Chapter 14, John*** sees the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with 144,000 who bear His name and the Father’s name on their foreheads, singing a new song before God’s throne (*vv. 1–5*). Three angels then proclaim messages to the world: the first calls all to fear God and worship Him; the second announces the fall of Babylon; the third warns that anyone who worships the beast or receives its mark will face God’s wrath (*vv. 6–11*). A call for the perseverance of the saints follows, blessing those who die in the Lord (*vv. 12–13*). John then sees two harvests: one like a Son of Man reaping the earth, and another in which grapes are gathered and thrown into the winepress of God’s wrath (*vv. 14–20*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb who stands with His redeemed on Mount Zion and the one like a Son of Man who executes God’s final harvest (*vv. 1, 14–16*).

***Believers should*** worship God alone, persevere in faithfulness, resist the beast’s system, and remain steadfast in hope even unto death (*vv. 7, 12–13*).

## Revelation 15

**A Scene of Heaven** *(15:1-8)*

> 1 Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.  
> 2 And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.  
> 3 And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,  
> *“Great and marvelous are Your works,*  
> *O Lord God, the Almighty;*  
> *Righteous and true are Your ways,*  
> *King of the nations!*  
> 4 *Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name?*  
> *For You alone are holy;*  
> *For all the nations will come and worship before You,*  
> *For Your righteous acts have been revealed.”*  
> 5 After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,  
> 6 and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.  
> 7 Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.  
> 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.

**Revelation 15 Summary**

***In Chapter 15, John*** sees another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues, which complete the wrath of God (*v. 1*). He then sees those who conquered the beast standing beside a sea of glass, holding harps of God and singing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb, praising God’s righteousness and His works (*vv. 2–4*). After this, the heavenly temple—the tabernacle of testimony—is opened, and the seven angels receive seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God. The temple fills with smoke from the glory of God so that no one can enter until the plagues are finished (*vv. 5–8*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb whose redeemed people praise Him for His righteous acts and deliverance, and whose victory over the beast is the basis of their worship (*vv. 2–4*).

***Believers should*** worship God for His righteous judgments, trust in His ultimate justice, and remain faithful as He brings His purposes to completion (*vv. 3–4*).

**Six Bowls of Wrath** *(16:1-12)*

> 1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, *“Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”*  
> 2 So the **first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth**; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.  
> 3 The **second angel poured out his bowl into the sea**, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.  
> 4 Then the **third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters**; and they became blood.  
> 5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying, *“Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things;*  
> 6 *for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.”*  
> 7 And I heard the altar saying, *“Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.”*  
> 8 The **fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun**, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.  
> 9 Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.  
> 10 Then the **fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast**, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain,  
> 11 and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.  
> 12 The **sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates;** and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east.

**Armageddon** *(16:13-16)*

> 13 And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;  
> 14 for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.  
> 15 (*“Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.”*)  
> 16 And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.

**Seventh Bowl of Wrath** *(16:17-21)*

> 17 Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, *“It is done.”*  
> 18 And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty.  
> 19 The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath.  
> 20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  
> 21 And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague was extremely severe.

**Revelation 16 Summary**

***In Chapter 16, John*** sees the seven angels pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath upon the earth. The first bowl brings harmful sores on those who bear the mark of the beast (*v. 2*). The second and third turn the sea and rivers into blood (*vv. 3–7*). The fourth bowl scorches people with fierce heat, yet they refuse to repent (*vv. 8–9*). The fifth plunges the beast’s kingdom into darkness (*vv. 10–11*). The sixth dries up the Euphrates to prepare the way for the kings of the east, as demonic spirits gather the nations for the battle of Armageddon (*vv. 12–16*). The seventh bowl brings a great earthquake, the fall of Babylon, and massive hailstones, yet people still blaspheme God (*vv. 17–21*).

***Christ is presented as*** the sovereign Lord whose judgments are poured out in perfect righteousness and whose return is anticipated even in the midst of wrath (*vv. 5–7, 15*).

***Believers should*** remain watchful, stay faithful and spiritually prepared, and trust in the justice of God’s judgments (*vv. 15, 7*).

**Doom of Babylon** *(17:1-13)*

> 1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, *“Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,*  
> 2 *with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.”*  
> 3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.  
> 4 The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,  
> 5 and on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, *“BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”*  
> 6 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly.  
> 7 And the angel said to me, *“Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.*  
> 8 *“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.*  
> 9 *Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,*  
> 10 *and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.*  
> 11 *The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction.*  
> 12 *The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.*  
> 13 *These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.*

**Victory for the Lamb** *(17:14-18)*

> 14 *These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.”*  
> 15 And he said to me, *“The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.*  
> 16 *And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.*  
> 17 *For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled.*  
> 18 *The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.”*

**Revelation 17 Summary**

***In Chapter 17, John*** is shown the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters, symbolizing a corrupt world system that influences nations and kings (*vv. 1–2, 15*). He sees a woman clothed in luxury, sitting on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, drunk with the blood of the saints (*vv. 3–6*). The angel explains that the seven heads represent seven mountains and also seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings who will receive authority with the beast and wage war against the Lamb (*vv. 7–14*). The Lamb will overcome them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are the called, chosen, and faithful (*v. 14*). The chapter ends with the beast and the ten kings turning against the harlot to destroy her, fulfilling God’s purpose (*vv. 16–18*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lord of lords and King of kings who overcomes all earthly powers and stands victorious with His faithful people (*v. 14*).

***Believers should*** remain faithful to Christ, resist the seduction and corruption of the world system, and trust that God’s sovereign purposes will prevail (*vv. 14, 17–18*).

**Babylon is Fallen** *(18:1-8)*

> 1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory.  
> 2 And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, *“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.*  
> 3 *For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.”*  
> 4 I heard another voice from heaven, saying, *“Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;*  
> 5 *for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.*  
> 6 *Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.*  
> 7 *To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as a queen and I am not a widow, and will never see mourning.’*  
> 8 *For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.*

**Lament for Babylon***(18:9-24)*

> 9 *“And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,*  
> 10 *standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’*  
> 11 *“And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more—*  
> 12 *cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,*  
> 13 *and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives.*  
> 14 *The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them.*  
> 15 *The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,*  
> 16 *saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;*  
> 17 *for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!’ And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,*  
> 18 *and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What city is like the great city?’*  
> 19 *And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!’*  
> 20 *Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.”*  
> 21 Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, *“So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.*  
> 22 *And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer;*  
> 23 *and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.*  
> 24 *And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.”*

**Revelation 18 Summary**

***In Chapter 18, John*** hears a mighty angel proclaim the fall of Babylon, the great city, because she has become a dwelling place of demons and has corrupted the nations with her immorality (*vv. 1–3*). A voice from heaven calls God’s people to come out of her so they will not share in her sins or plagues (*v. 4*). Her judgment comes swiftly as kings, merchants, and shipmasters mourn the loss of her wealth and power, standing far off in fear of her torment (*vv. 9–19*). Heaven, however, rejoices over her downfall because God has judged her for her corruption and violence against the saints (*vv. 20–24*). A strong angel casts a millstone into the sea, symbolizing Babylon’s complete and permanent destruction (*vv. 21–23*).

***Christ is presented as*** the righteous Judge who brings final judgment on the world’s corrupt system and vindicates His people (*vv. 8, 20*).

***Believers should*** separate themselves from Babylon’s sins, remain faithful and undefiled, and rejoice in God’s just and final judgment (*vv. 4–5, 20*).

**The Forefold Hallelujah** *(19:1-6)*

> 1 After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,  
> *“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God;*  
> 2 *because His judgments are true and righteous; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and He has avenged the blood of His bond-servants on her.”*  
> 3 And a second time they said, *“Hallelujah! Her smoke rises up forever and ever.”*  
> 4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, *“Amen. Hallelujah!”*  
> 5 And a voice came from the throne, saying,  
> *“Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and the great.”*  
> 6 Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying,  
> *“Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.*

**Marriage of the Lamb** *(19:7-10)*

> 7 *Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.”*  
> 8 It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.  
> 9 Then he said to me, *"Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’ ”* And he said to me, *“These are true words of God.”*  
> 10 Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, *“Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”*

**The Coming of Christ** *(19:11-19)*

> 11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.  
> 12 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; **and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.**  
> 13 He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.  
> 14 And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.  
> 15 From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.  
> 16 And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, *“KING OF KINGS, AND Lord OF LORDS.”*  
> 17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, *“Come, assemble for the great supper of God,*  
> 18 *so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.”*  
> 19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.

**Doom of the Beast and the False Prophet** *(19:20-21)*

> 20 And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.  
> 21 And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.

**Revelation 19 Summary**

***In Chapter 19, John*** hears a great multitude in heaven praising God for judging Babylon and avenging the blood of His servants (*vv. 1–5*). The scene shifts to the marriage of the Lamb, as the bride—arrayed in fine linen—has made herself ready (*vv. 6–8*). John is told that blessed are those invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb (*v. 9*). Heaven then opens, and a rider on a white horse appears—called Faithful and True—who judges and wages war in righteousness. His eyes are like fire, and on His robe and thigh is written: *King of kings and Lord of lords* (*vv. 11–16*). The beast, false prophet, and their armies gather to make war against Him, but they are defeated; the beast and false prophet are thrown alive into the lake of fire, and the rest are slain (*vv. 17–21*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb whose marriage has come, and the victorious Rider on the white horse—Faithful and True, the Word of God, King of kings, and Lord of lords—who judges in righteousness and triumphs over all His enemies (*vv. 7, 11–16*).

***Believers should*** rejoice in God’s righteous judgments, prepare themselves in purity for the marriage of the Lamb, and trust in Christ’s ultimate victory over all evil (*vv. 7–8, 5, 11–16*).

## Revelation 20

**Satan Bound** *(20:1-6)*

> 1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.  
> 2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;  
> 3 and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.  
> 4 Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.  
> 5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.  
> 6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.

**Satan Freed, Doomed** *(20:7-10)*

> 7 When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,  
> 8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.  
> 9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.  
> 10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

**Judgment at the Throne of God** *(20:11-15)*

> 11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.  
> 12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.  
> 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.  
> 14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.  
> 15 And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

**Revelation 20 Summary**

***In Chapter 20, John*** sees an angel binding Satan for a thousand years and casting him into the abyss so that he can no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years are completed (*vv. 1–3*). John then sees thrones, and those who were martyred for their testimony reign with Christ during this millennium in what is called the first resurrection (*vv. 4–6*). After the thousand years, Satan is released and deceives the nations once more, gathering them for battle, but fire from heaven consumes them. Satan is then thrown into the lake of fire forever (*vv. 7–10*). John next sees a great white throne where the dead are judged according to their deeds; anyone not found in the book of life is cast into the lake of fire (*vv. 11–15*).

***Christ is presented as*** the reigning King during the millennium, the Judge at the great white throne, and the conqueror who brings the final defeat of Satan and all evil (*vv. 4, 11–15*).

***Believers should*** remain faithful to Christ’s reign, take confidence in His ultimate judgment and justice, and live in readiness for the resurrection and eternal life (*vv. 4–6, 12*).

**The New Heaven and Earth** *(21:1-9)*

> 1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.  
> 2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.  
> 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, *“Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,*  
> 4 *and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”*  
> 5 And He who sits on the throne said, *“Behold, I am making all things new.”* And He said, *“Write, for these words are faithful and true.”*  
> 6 Then He said to me, *“It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.*  
> 7 *He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.*  
> 8 *But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”*  
> 9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, *“Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”*

**The New Jerusalem** *(21:10-27)*

> 10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,  
> 11 having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper.  
> 12 It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names were written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.  
> 13 There were three gates on the east and three gates on the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west.  
> 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  
> 15 The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall.  
> 16 The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.  
> 17 And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, according to human measurements, which are also angelic measurements.  
> 18 The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.  
> 19 The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;  
> 20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.  
> 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.  
> 22 I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.  
> 23 And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.  
> 24 The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.  
> 25 In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed;  
> 26 and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;  
> 27 and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

**Revelation 21 Summary**

***In Chapter 21, John*** sees a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and earth have passed away (*v. 1*). He beholds the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband (*v. 2*). A loud voice declares that God will dwell among His people, wipe away every tear, and remove death, mourning, crying, and pain forever (*vv. 3–4*). God, seated on the throne, announces, *“Behold, I am making all things new,”* affirming that He is the Alpha and the Omega and promising the water of life to the one who thirsts (*vv. 5–7*). But the cowardly, unbelieving, immoral, and idolatrous will face the second death in the lake of fire (*v. 8*). One of the angels shows John the holy city, the New Jerusalem, described with radiant glory, precious stones, twelve gates named after Israel’s tribes, and twelve foundations named after the apostles (*vv. 9–14*). The city is measured, shining with the glory of God, needing no temple because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple, and needing no sun or moon because the glory of God illumines it, and the Lamb is its lamp (*vv. 15–23*). Only those written in the Lamb’s book of life may enter (*vv. 24–27*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Alpha and Omega, the Lamb who is the light and temple of the New Jerusalem, the giver of the water of life, and the one whose redeemed dwell forever in His presence (*vv. 5–7, 22–23, 27*).

***Believers should*** long for the new creation, trust God’s promises, pursue holiness, and live as those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life (*vv. 3–4, 7, 27*).

**The River and the Tree of Life** *(22:1-9)*

> 1 Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,  
> 2 in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  
> 3 There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;  
> 4 they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.  
> 5 And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.

## Conclusion

> 6 And he said to me, *“These words are faithful and true”*; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.  
> 7 *“And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.”*  
> 8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.  
> 9 But he said to me, *“Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book. Worship God.”*

**The Final Message** *(22:10-21)*

> 10 And he said to me, *“Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.*  
> 11 *Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy.”*  
> 12 *“Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.*  
> 13 *I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”*  
> 14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.  
> 15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.  
> 16 **“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”**  
> 17 The Spirit and the bride say, *“Come.”* And let the one who hears say, *“Come.”* And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.  
> 18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;  
> 19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.  
> 20 He who testifies to these things says, *“Yes, I am coming quickly.”* Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.  
> 21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.

**Revelation 22 Summary**

***In Chapter 22, John*** sees the river of the water of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb, with the tree of life on both sides of the river bearing twelve kinds of fruit and leaves for the healing of the nations (*vv. 1–2*). No longer will there be any curse, for the throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city, and His servants will see His face and serve Him forever (*vv. 3–5*). The angel affirms that these words are faithful and true, and Jesus declares, *“Behold, I am coming quickly.”* John is instructed not to seal up the prophecy, for the time is near (*vv. 6–10*). Christ announces blessings to the obedient and warnings to the wicked, declaring Himself the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last (*vv. 12–15*). The Spirit and the bride invite all who are thirsty to come and take the water of life without cost (*v. 17*). A solemn warning is given not to add to or take away from the words of this prophecy (*vv. 18–19*). The book ends with the promise, *“Yes, I am coming quickly,”* and John’s prayer, *“Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.”* (*vv. 20–21*).

***Christ is presented as*** the Lamb whose throne is with God, the giver of the water of life, the one whose face believers will see, the Alpha and Omega, and the one who is coming quickly to reward, judge, and restore all things (*vv. 3–5, 12–13, 20*).

***Believers should*** long for Christ’s return, obey His words, come to Him for the water of life, worship and serve Him faithfully, and guard the integrity of Scripture (*vv. 6–7, 14, 17–20*).

## Class Exercise

Read Rev. 6:5-16 and have your students find the words as or like in the text. Note how many times it is used.  
**These are similes, John’s favorite way to describe things beyond his comprehension.**  

What is John trying to communicate by these similes? Note that we read into these our own cultural and historical interpretations and cannot know what these events will exactly look like in a futuristic setting.

Share the following quote from Burge, Cohick, and Greene, The New Testament in Antiquity: A Survey of the New Testament within Its Cultural Context, *“In antiquity, numbers meant far more than their numerical value. They were symbols.*  
*Pythagoras considered 3, 5, and 7 as masculine, 2, 4, and 6 as feminine. Ten was the perfect number since it is a ‘triangular number’ (from a triangle of dots with four on each side). The Pythagoreans followed Aristotle seeing 7 as symbolizing the first cause, and itself was unused – hence, the unmoved mover.”*

Note that this differs from the Hebrew symbols for numbers.

State your personal interpretive approach and some of its characteristics and why you use it.
