title: NTSurvey - Session 17 Part 1 - Revelation
date: 95 A.D
writer: John the Apostle
category: Prophecy
description: John wrote the Revelation in order to unite and complete the prophetic truth of the Bible. Without the book of Revelation there would be many unanswered questions about the end times. John also wrote to encourage the people of his day as they were enduring Roman persecution. They needed to know that persecution would never destroy God's church or God's purposes. This, of course, has continued to be an encouragement to persecuted believers throughout the ages.

### Theme of Revelation

John writes about the great end-time events that will occur during the Day of the Lord. The focus of this book is on the seven-year Tribulation, but also includes information about the second coming of Christ and about His millennial kingdom, which will be established on this earth. The great prophetic themes of the Bible are dealt with in this book.

## Revelation Summary

### I. Introduction

**The Revelation of Jesus Christ** *(1:1-3)*

> 1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John,  
> 2 who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.  
> 3 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.

**Message to the Seven Churches** *(1:4-8)*

> 4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,  
> 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood—  
> 6 and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.  
> 7 Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.  
> 8 *“I am the Alpha and the Omega,”* says the Lord God, *“who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”*

### II. The Things Which Thou Hast Seen The Person of Christ

**The Patmos Vision** *(9-20)*

> 9 I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.  
> 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet,  
> 11 saying, *“Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”*  
> 12 Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;  
> 13 and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash.  
> 14 His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire.  
> 15 His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.  
> 16 In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.  
> 17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, *“Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,*  
> 18 *and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.*  
> 19 *Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things.*  
> 20 *As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.*

**Revelation Chapter 1 Summary**

***In Chapter 1, John*** receives the revelation of Jesus Christ while exiled on Patmos. He is instructed to write what he sees to the seven churches in Asia (*vv. 1–3, 9–11*). John describes a vision of the risen Christ standing among seven golden lampstands, holding seven stars in His right hand. His appearance is majestic and overwhelming—His voice like many waters, His face shining like the sun, and His eyes like a flame of fire (*vv. 12–16*). John falls at His feet, but Christ declares, *“Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last… I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore”* (*vv. 17–18*). The mystery of the lampstands and stars is explained: the lampstands are the seven churches, and the stars are their angels (*v. 20*).  
***Christ is presented as*** the risen, glorified Son of Man, eternal and sovereign, holding authority over death and Hades, walking among His churches, and revealing Himself with divine majesty (*vv. 12–18*).  
***Believers should*** hear the words of this prophecy, keep what is written, and live in reverent awareness of Christ’s presence and authority (*vv. 3, 11, 19*).

### III. The Things Which Are The Possessions of Christ

**Message to Ephesus** *(2:1-7)*

> 1 *“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:*  
> *The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, says this:*  
> 2 *‘I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false;*  
> 3 *and you have perseverance and have endured for My name’s sake, and have not grown weary.*  
> 4 *But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.*  
> 5 *Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place—unless you repent.*  
> 6 *Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.*  
> 7 *He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.’*

**Message to Smyrna** *(2:8-11)*

> 8 *“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write:*  
> *The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life, says this:*  
> 9 *‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.*  
> 10 *Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.*  
> 11 *He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.’*

**Message to Pergamum** (2:12-17)*

> 12 *“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write:*  
> *The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this:*  
> 13 *‘I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.*  
> 14 *But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality.*  
> 15 *So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.*  
> 16 *Therefore repent; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth.*  
> 17 *He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.’*

**Message to Thyatira** *(2:18-29)*

> 18 *“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write:*  
> *The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like burnished bronze, says this:*  
> 19 *‘I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first.*  
> 20 *But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.*  
> 21 *I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality.*  
> 22 *Behold, I will throw her on a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds.*  
> 23 *And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.*  
> 24 *But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them—I place no other burden on you.*  
> 25 *Nevertheless what you have, hold fast until I come.*  
> 26 *He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;*  
> 27 *and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to pieces, as I also have received authority from My Father;*  
> 28 *and I will give him the morning star.*  
> 29 *He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’*

**Revelation Chapter 2 Summary**

***In Chapter 2, John*** relays Christ’s messages to the first four churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, and Thyatira. Ephesus is commended for endurance but rebuked for abandoning its first love and called to repent (*vv. 1–7*). Smyrna is encouraged to remain faithful unto death amid suffering (*vv. 8–11*). Pergamum is praised for holding fast to Christ’s name yet rebuked for tolerating false teaching and immorality, urged to repent (*vv. 12–17*). Thyatira is commended for love, faith, service, and perseverance but rebuked for permitting a false prophetess who misleads believers into immorality; those who hold fast will receive authority from Christ (*vv. 18–29*).  
***Christ is presented as*** the one who walks among the churches, knows their works, holds the sharp two-edged sword, is the First and the Last, and searches minds and hearts (*vv. 1, 8, 12, 18, 23*).  
***Believers should*** repent where needed, reject false teaching, remain faithful in suffering, persevere in works of love and holiness, and hold fast until Christ comes (*vv. 5, 10, 16, 24–26*).

**Message to Sardis** *(3:1-6)*

> 1 *“To the angel of the church in Sardis write:*  
> *He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: ‘I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.*  
> 2 *Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God.*  
> 3 *So remember what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent. Therefore if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.*  
> 4 *But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.*  
> 5 *He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.*  
> 6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’*

**Message to Philadelphia** *(3:7-13)*

> 7 *“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:*  
> *He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says this:*  
> 8 *‘I know your  deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut, because you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.*  
> 9 *Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and make them know that I have loved you.*  
> 10 *Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.*  
> 11 *I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown.*  
> 12 *He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.*  
> 13 *He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’*

**Message to Laodicea** *(3:14-22)*

> 14 *“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:*  
> *The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the  Beginning of the creation of God, says this:*  
> 15 *‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.*  
> 16 *So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.*  
> 17 *Because you say, “I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,*  
> 18 *I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.*  
> 19 *Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.*  
> 20 *Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.*  
> 21 He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.*  
> 22 *He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ ”*

**Revelation Chapter 3 Summary**

***In Chapter 3, John*** delivers Christ’s messages to the churches in Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. Sardis has a reputation for life but is spiritually dead; Christ commands them to wake up, strengthen what remains, and repent (*vv. 1–6*). Philadelphia is commended for keeping Christ’s word and not denying His name; Christ promises protection, an open door no one can shut, and a permanent place in God’s temple (*vv. 7–13*). Laodicea is rebuked for being lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—and is urged to buy true spiritual riches from Christ and open the door to Him in repentance (*vv. 14–22*).  
***Christ is presented as*** the one who has the seven spirits of God, the holy and true one with the key of David, the faithful and true witness, the beginning (origin) of God’s creation, and the one who disciplines those He loves (*vv. 1, 7, 14, 19*).  
***Believers should*** wake up spiritually, keep Christ’s word, endure, repent of lukewarmness, open the door to Christ’s fellowship, and hold fast their faith until He comes (*vv. 3, 8, 11, 19–20*).

## Class Exercise

Read the first chapter of Revelation.  

**Discussion Questions:**  

- What is the portrait of John in these verses? How does that fit with what we know of him?  
**He was in exile, he was the gospel writer (v. 2), that his focus was Ephesus, and the province of Asia (v. 4), etc.**

Read Nelson, Maps and Charts p. 451 to identify Patmos and the proximity of 7 churches on a route. Note that there are other churches we know of not mentioned in Revelation but on the same route.  
**Have your students name other churches.**  

- Why would John select these?  
**Because he knew them and this could lead to the suggestion that our Lord chose them for their typical model.**  

Turning their attention to chapters 2 & 3, assign students or groups each a church and ask them to identify the problem addressed and the response commanded.  
**For example, the Ephesian church 2:1ff has left its first love or perhaps turned its worship into routine ritual. It needs to refresh its commitment and relation to the Lord Jesus.**  

Using the phrase “Day of the Lord,” have your students look up references in both testaments. Share details about this day from their findings.  
**Write the list on a white board or flip chart. Think about why and how the Revelation may pull these details together.**  

- How does John unite these details?  
**John gives structure and detail to the biblical expectations of the day of the Lord.**  

- Why do you think it is significant that Jesus said ‘write’ twice in vv. 11 & 19?
**While many discount The Revelation as irrelevant, already fulfilled, or too difficult, Jesus has inspired it for all His church throughout the ages.**  

After reading Rev. 1:3 & 19, ask your students to compare these verses and describe John’s purpose for his readers in writing The Revelation. Ask them to speculate about how 1:19 could be an outline template for the Revelation.  
**Discuss its relevance today.**
