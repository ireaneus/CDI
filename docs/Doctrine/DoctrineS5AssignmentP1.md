# Session 5 Part 1 - The Enternal Decrees of God

## Concept 1
**From eternity, God has had an unchangeable plan with regard to His creation.**

**Notes**
- Absolute Sovereign
- Omnipotent

**Scriptures**
- Ephesians 1:4
> just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love- 2 Timothy 1:9
- 2 Timothy 1:9 
> who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity

## Concept 2
**God comprehends and determines all things and events that come to pass.**
- However, God does not sin!
- God does allow sin, but He always superintends it for His own perfect purpose.

**Notes**

**Scriptures**
- Ephesians 1:11
> also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,
- Proverbs 21:1
> The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord;
> He turns it wherever He wishes.
- Philippians 2:13
> for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.
- Acts 2:23
> this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death. 
- Job 1:12
> Then the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.” So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.
- Acts 4:27-28
> For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 28to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur.

## Concept 3
**All God’s decrees are unconditional and sovereign.**
- God’s decrees are by no means dependent on human action.
- The end that God has in view will inevitably come to pass.

**Notes**

**Scriptures**
- Daniel 4:35
> All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,
> But He does according to His will in the host of heaven
> And among the inhabitants of earth;
> And no one can ward off His hand
> Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’
- Ephesians 1:5
> He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
- Romans 9
> Solicitude for Israel  
> 8. That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.  
> 11. for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,  
> 12. it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger.” 13Just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”  
> 15. for He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”  
> 16. So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.  
> 17. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I raised you up, to demonstrate My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.”  
> 18. So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.  
> 19. You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?”  
> 20. On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, “Why did you make me like this,” will it?  
> 21. Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?  
> 22. What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?  
> 24. even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.  
> 25. As He says also in Hosea,  
> “I will call those who were not My people, ‘My people,’  
> And her who was not beloved, ‘beloved.’”  
> 26. “And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘you are not My people,’  
> There they shall be called sons of the living God.”  
> 27. Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved;  
> 28. for the Lord will execute His word on the earth, thoroughly and quickly.”
> 30. What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;  
> 31. but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.  
> 32. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,

### Notes

**Scriptures**
- Habakuk 1:13
> Your eyes are too pure to approve evil,
> And You can not look on wickedness with favor.
> Why do You look with favor
> On those who deal treacherously?
> Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up
> Those more righteous than they?


## Human Free Agency

### Notes
**Anthropocentric** and **Theocentric** are two terms that describe different perspectives in theology and philosophy:
- **Anthropocentric** (from *anthropos*, meaning "human") refers to a human-centered viewpoint. In theology, it emphasizes humanity's role, needs, and experiences as central. It often focuses on how religious beliefs or practices benefit people or how God relates specifically to human life. 
- **Theocentric** (from *theos*, meaning "God") refers to a God-centered viewpoint. This perspective prioritizes God as the central focus of everything, emphasizing His will, glory, and purposes as supreme. In theology, this viewpoint emphasizes God’s sovereignty and the idea that all creation, including humanity, exists to glorify Him. 

In summary, **anthropocentric** focuses on humanity, while **theocentric** focuses on God. 

**Scripture**
- Romans 9:20-23
- 2 Peter 3
