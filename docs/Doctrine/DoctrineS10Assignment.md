# Session 10 Part 1 - Soterialogy: Regeneration & Justification

**What does the General call look like, and the Effectual call look like**

## The General call
**Scripture references**
- Matt 20:16
- Matt 22:14

## The effectual call
**Scripture references**
- John 10:27
- John 6:66-69
- Acts 2:1-40
- John 3:3
- Rom 10:17



To illustrate what the **General Call** and **Effectual Call** look like, we will examine each type of call and how it is represented in Scripture.

---

### **The General Call**

The **General Call** refers to the broad proclamation of the gospel message to all people. It is an invitation extended to everyone to repent, believe in Christ, and receive salvation. However, not everyone who hears this call responds positively; many may reject or ignore it. The General Call is an essential part of evangelism, as it allows the gospel to be heard by all.

- **Scripture References**:
    - **Matthew 20:16**  
    *"So the last shall be first, and the first last."*  
    - In this context, Jesus speaks about the general nature of the call to follow Him. Many are invited into God's kingdom, but the outcome is determined by how they respond.

    - **Matthew 22:14**  
    *"For many are called, but few are chosen."*  
    - This verse highlights the distinction between the General Call that goes out to many and the fact that only some respond in a way that leads to salvation. It indicates that while the invitation is given to all, only those who are "chosen" will experience the transforming power of the Effectual Call.

**Examples of the General Call in Practice**:
1. **Preaching the Gospel to Crowds**: When the gospel is preached publicly, as Jesus did with large crowds or as the apostles did in various cities, it represents the General Call. For example, Peter's sermon in Acts 2 was a General Call to repentance, addressed to everyone listening.
2. **Invitations to Repent and Believe**: Anytime the gospel message is shared, whether in a church setting, personal evangelism, or through written materials, it constitutes the General Call.

### **The Effectual Call**

The **Effectual Call** is the inward call of God, through the Holy Spirit, that leads to a genuine response of faith and repentance. This call is irresistible, meaning that it effectively brings about a change in the person’s heart, enabling them to respond positively to the gospel. Those who receive the Effectual Call will inevitably come to faith in Christ.

- **Scripture References**:
    - **John 10:27**  
    *"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me."*  
    - Jesus speaks of His sheep as those who recognize His voice and follow Him. This illustrates the Effectual Call, as it emphasizes that those whom He calls will respond.

    - **John 6:66-69**  
    *"As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore. So Jesus said to the twelve, 'You do not want to go away also, do you?' Simon Peter answered Him, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.'"*  
    - Peter’s confession here is evidence of the Effectual Call. While many rejected Jesus, those who were called by God recognized the truth and followed Him.

    - **Acts 2:1-40** (Focus on verses 37-39)  
    *"Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brethren, what shall we do?' Peter said to them, 'Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'"*  
    - The response of the people who were "pierced to the heart" indicates the Effectual Call. The Holy Spirit worked in them to produce conviction, leading them to ask how they could be saved.

    - **John 3:3**  
    *"Jesus answered and said to him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"*  
    - The new birth is a result of the Effectual Call. The Holy Spirit enables a person to be "born again," making it possible for them to see and enter the kingdom of God.

    - **Romans 10:17**  
    *"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."*  
    - While the General Call is made through the preaching of the Word, the Effectual Call occurs when the Holy Spirit works through the preached message to produce saving faith in the hearer.

**Examples of the Effectual Call in Practice**:
1. **Conversion Experiences**: When an individual hears the gospel and is deeply convicted, leading to a genuine conversion and lifelong commitment to Christ, it is an example of the Effectual Call.
2. **The Transformation of the Heart**: The Effectual Call involves a change in the person's inner disposition toward God, often described as regeneration or being "born again" (John 3:3).

### Summary of the Distinction:

- **The General Call** is outward and goes to everyone; it is resistible, and not all who hear it will respond in faith.  
- **The Effectual Call** is inward, applied by the Holy Spirit; it is irresistible and brings about a sure response of faith and repentance in those whom God has chosen.

These calls work together in God's plan of salvation, with the General Call providing the means by which the gospel is proclaimed, and the Effectual Call ensuring that those whom God has elected will respond to the message.
