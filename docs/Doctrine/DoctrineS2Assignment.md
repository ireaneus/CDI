# Session 2 Part 1 - The essence and Attributes of God
**Theology is the study of God and how He relates to His universe**  
**Doctrine is a teaching or a clearly defined belief about something, in this case about God.**

Scripture is His prime defense. If a discussion about God is to take place then the understanding between all involved is that the Word of God, is in fact, all Truth, inerrant, infallable, immutable, inspired Word of God.

## The Bible assumes God's existence
- Genesis 1:1
> *In the beginning God,*
- Psalm 19:1
> *"The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands."*
- Romans 1:20
> *"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse."*
- Hebrews 11:6
> *"And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him."*
- Isaiah 45:12
> *"It is I who made the earth, and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands and I ordained all their host."*
- John 1:1-3
> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being."*

## Ample evidence for God's existence
**General Revelation** - is evidence for God's existence in the creation. 
- Romans 1:19-20
> *"because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse."*

**Special Revelation** - is passed down to us in the bible in three ways: Spoken word, written word, and walking word. We have all of it in the canon of scripture recorded.
- Romans 10:17
> *"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."*
- **Isaiah 55:11**
> *"So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;*  
> *It will not return to Me empty,*  
> *Without accomplishing what I desire,*  
> *And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.*

## Arguments from philosophy (Human Intellect)
### a priori - Argument strictly taken from reason.  
**Examples**
- Anselm's argument - also known as the ontological argument, asserts that God, being the greatest conceivable being, must exist in reality because existence is a necessary attribute of greatness.
- Descartes's argument - Descartes argues that the very concept of a perfect being (God) implies its existence, as existence is a necessary attribute of perfection.

### a psteriori - Argument taken as a conclusion from observations.
**Examples**
- Clarke's argument, known as the **cosmological argument**, claims that there must be a necessary being (God) who exists independently and is the cause of all contingent beings, as the existence of the universe requires an uncaused first cause.
- **Teleological Argument (Argument from Design)**: This argument asserts that the order, complexity, and purpose observed in the universe suggest an intelligent designer (God), as natural processes alone are unlikely to produce such intricacies.
- **Moral Argument**: This argument claims that the existence of objective moral values and duties is best explained by the existence of a moral lawgiver (God), as moral laws require a transcendent source.
- **Conceptual Argument**: This is often associated with the idea that the existence of certain concepts, like the concept of God or universals, implies the existence of God or a higher reality, as such concepts need an ultimate grounding beyond human thought.

**Using Occam's Razor, one could argue:** 
> *"The existence of God, as the simplest explanation for the origin and order of the universe, avoids unnecessary assumptions about alternative complex causes."*

**Weakness of philosphical arguments => Starting with human intellect**
- Proverbs 14:12
> *There is a way which seems right to a man,*  
> *But its end is the way of death.*
- John 3:3
> *Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”*

**Faith requires intervention by God the Holy Spirit**
- Ephesians 2:8-9
> *For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.*
- Psalm 53:1
> *The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God,”*  
> *They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice;*  
> *There is no one who does good.*
