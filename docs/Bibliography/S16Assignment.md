## Paraphrase 1 John 1:1-2:2 

### Jesus the Son of God, dwelt among men
**1 John 1:1-4**
*Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God, who was before all things, in all things and through all things has been manifested to us, He dwelt among us, we saw Him, heard His voice, touched Him. We proclaim this truth that He tabernacled among us, we will continue to testify to this, again we proclaim that He came down from heaven in the form of a man and spent 3 years with us, in order that you may believe and fellowship with us, but more importantly that you have fellowship with God the father through our Lord Jesus Christ, so that our joy may be made complete.

### God is Light
**1 John 1:5-10**
*This is the testamony, we have heard from Him and proclaim to you, that God is Light and in Him there is no darkness at all. meaning He is perfect, holy and righteous and if we say we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness then we lie and the truth is not in us. But if we walk in His Light, as there is no other light apart from Him, we have fellowship not only with one another but with God the Father and His Son. The only way we can do this is because Jesus cleanses us from all sin and has removed all darkness from us. However if we continue in sin, we can restore our fellowship with Him and one another by confessing our sins and He will cleanse us from our darkness.  If we deceive ourselves in thinking we have no sin then we make Him a liar and His truth is not in us.*

### Christ is our Advocate
**1 John 2:1-2**
*Children, these things are written to you who believe, that if you do sin we have One that is pleading with the Father on our behalf, because of Him, and His righteousness has provided the payment for our sin, not only for our sins alone but for the whole world.*
