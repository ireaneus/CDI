bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**The Challenges of the Age of Progress – 1789-1914 AD**

- The French Revolution unleashed new hopes for the common person, just as science raised new questions for traditional Christians.
- Power seemed to be within the reach of the masses.
- For Christianity, this meant that new social unrest was added to the challenge of intellectual doubts.
- How are Christians supposed to meet the needs of the urban masses?
- Was man simply a product of evolutionary forces?
- Christians were seriously divided over ways to face these problems.
- Without the traditional support of the State, many Protestants turned to voluntary societies to minister to the poor and the oppressed, as well as to carry the gospel to foreign lands.

**The French Revolution**

- The supposedly firm ground of popular belief in the new era was the doctrine of human progress.
- The human race was getting better and growing happier – that was the new creed.
- The democratic gospel of the French Revolution rested upon the glorification of man rather than God.
- The Catholic Church recognized this and struck back at the heresy – as she had always done, trying to use her power. She saw more clearly than did most Protestant churches that the devil, when it is to his advantage, is democratic.
- Ten thousand people telling a lie do not turn the lie into truth.
- This is an important lesson from the Age of Progress for Christians of every generation.
- The Bible clearly teaches us, that the majority is often wrong.
- Inspired by the American Revolution, the sordid facts of what happened on July 14, 1789, were speedily transformed into the heroic deeds of the French Revolution.

**Liberty, Equality and Fraternity**

- Liberty, equality and fraternity were not only the call of the French Revolution; it was the spirit of the age.
- Augustine had taught, more than 1000 years before, that liberty comes by grace and not grace by liberty.
- Christianity understands that to be properly free man must be in a state of salvation, so throughout these centuries Christians had little enthusiasm for the idea of man’s improper, unchecked freedom. Here is another example of our need to keep balanced.
- The idea that everyone ought to be as free as possible was summed up in the statement: *“The liberty of each is limited by the liberty of all.”*
- In practice, this meant a constitutional government that guaranteed civil liberties to all, including the freedom to worship according to personal choice.
- This meant resistance to a return to monarchies (including a “pope-king”).
- By 1848 the liberal revolution had triumphed, at least temporarily, in almost every capital in Europe.
- Ironically, the year 1870 not only marked the end of the Papal States after 1,000 years; it also signified the declaration of the supreme authority of the Bishop of Rome and the doctrine of papal infallibility.

**The Fortress Mentality**

- One of the lessons the Church should learn from our history is the danger of a “fortress mentality.”
- Fortresses have a decided disadvantage.
- They grow stuff. They allow no enlargement of thinking and after a time you begin to imagine that the only world of any importance lies within the walls.
- Luther’s hymn is entitled: *“A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,”* not *“A Mighty Fortress is the Church.”* That is not a Biblical picture of the Church.

**Into the World**

- The evangelical movement in England, sparked by Whitefield and the Wesleys, moved the Church to fulfill our two-fold commission.
- God has sent His people INTO the world to proclaim salvation and to serve the needy.
- God has called his own FROM the world to worship and learn of Him.
- **Mission without worship can produce empty service, just as worship without mission can lead to careless religion.**

**Voluntary Religious Societies**

- Because of their freedom, Christians could form a variety of religious societies that were not churches in the traditional sense but involved Christians from various churches working together for some specific objective.
- Some Evangelicals were from “High Churches” with an emphasis on sacraments and the styles of rituals.
- Others were from “Low Churches” who considered the preaching of the gospel as most important.
- Each was loyal to their church but willing to work together for the fulfillment of the twofold commission.
- The Clapham Community, with William Wilberforce as their leader, is an example of one of these groups that tackled many issues by setting up organizations to work on a variety of causes. Among them were:
    - The Church Missionary Society.
    - The British and Foreign Bible Society.
    - The Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor.
    - The Society for the Reformation of Prison Discipline.
    - Their most famous effort was the elimination of slavery and the slave trade in England and its territories.

**The Era of Christian Expansion**

- At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Protestant Christianity scarcely existed outside of Europe and America, but the century proved to be a great era of Christian expansion.
- The Church Historian, Kenneth Scott Latourette said, *“Never had any other set of ideas, religious or secular, been propagated over so wide an area by so many professional agents maintained by the unconstrained donations of so many millions of individuals.”*
- William Carey was a most unlikely candidate to be considered *“The Father of Modern Missions.”*
- However, he was typical of those God chooses to accomplish His work, *“so that no man may boast before God.”* (**1 Corinthians 1:29**)
- He firmly believed that the foreign missionary can never make more than a small contribution to the accomplishment of the work to be done, and that therefore the development of the local ministry (the Church) is the first and greatest of all missionary considerations.
- Above all, he saw that Christianity must be firmly rooted in the culture and traditions of the land in which it is planted.
- Carey is included with a long list of missionary pioneers who gave their lives to cut the path for others to follow.
- This new passion to preach the gospel to the *“heathen”* sprang from those portions of Protestantism deeply influenced by the eighteenth-century evangelical revivals in England and America; which revolutionized preaching and its objectives.
- Christianity in this era, especially Protestant Christianity, had several characteristics that highlighted its expansion.
- First, the worldwide expansion usually came by choice not by compulsion. They advanced without state support or control and only by the power of persuasion.
- Second, the support for this movement came from the wealth and the talents of ordinary Protestants.
- Third, there was a wide variety of humanitarian ministries accompanying the widespread preaching of the gospel. Mission agencies established schools, hospitals and orphanages along with churches.

**Counter Attack**

- It is not surprising to see a counter-attack from the enemy as the Church advanced.
- In America, the Civil War and the moral issue of slavery along with the political issue of states’ rights consumed lives, wealth and energy.
- Before the nation could get back on its feet, Charles Darwin’s The Origin of the Species challenged the Church and the accuracy of the Bible.
- On a broader scale, the Church in England and America had to face a direct assault on the Scriptures in the form of higher criticism of the Bible, much of it from Germany.
- Higher criticism of the Bible involves the use of scientific techniques of literary criticism to establish the sources of the books of the Bible. Mostly its purpose was to discredit any idea supernatural revelation.
- Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albert Ritschl were the two most influential representatives for Liberalism – we will see them too often in our study of the History of Christian Doctrine.
- Then there was a cultural shift of increasing industrialization and a rush to the cities.
- Small towns became big cities almost overnight and the rural communities lost many of their young people and their workforce.

**The Industrial Revolution**

- With the Industrial Revolution, there was a rising tide of problems related to the crowding of cities, the influx of immigrants and the abuse of workers.
- Into this sea of misery two individuals waded – Karl Marx and William Booth. Marx offered a political solution (Communism) and Booth offered a spiritual solution (The Salvation Army) with a very practical application of compassion and help.
- It is always possible to concentrate on the next life so much that Christians appear insensitive to the pain of the present.
- The various Christian movements for social concerns always faced the danger of losing the Church’s true mission.
- However, Christians cannot show their concern for people’s eternal destiny unless they also demonstrate their concern for people’s earthly needs.
- I am sure you have heard the saying: *“People do not care how much you know, until they know how much you care.”*
- May we be faithful to present the love of God in our words and in our deeds.

**Review**

- The Church faced another set of new challenges in the Age of Progress:
    - The imbalance of the spirit of the French Revolution.
    - The temptation to retreat to our fortresses and bar the gates.
    - The challenge to fulfill the Great Commission and take the Gospel message and the demonstration of God’s love to the whole world.

**In the Next Session**

- We will discuss the seven chapters in The Age of Ideologies and the Age of Global Expansion and Relocation.

## Key Verses

- *“It was for freedom that Christ set us free”* (**Galatians 5:1**)
- *“Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin”* (**John 8:34**)
- *“if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed”* (**John 8:36**)
- *"For you were called to freedom, brethren"* (**Galatians 5:13**)
- *“the perfect law, the law of liberty”* (**James 1:25**)
- *"but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition"* (**2 Timothy 2:22-26**)

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE AGE OF PROGRESS**

For the rest of this session, have your student discuss what they have learned and written in their summary of each of the six chapters in *“The Age of Progress.”*

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters.

Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group. You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**  
Church History in Plain Language  
by Bruce Shelley  

**The Age of Progress – 1789-1914 AD**  
Christians saw new social unrest added to the intellectual challenges stemming from the rise of modern science. The French Revolution unleashed new hopes for the common man. Power seemed to be within the reach of the masses. How are Christians supposed to meet the needs of the urban masses? Was man simply a product of evolutionary forces? Christians were seriously divided over ways to face these problems. Without the traditional support of the State, many Protestants turned to voluntary societies to minister to the poor and the oppressed, as well as to carry the gospel to foreign lands.

## Question 1

**Read and discuss “Liberty in an Ancient Sense” on pages 374-375. How is this ancient sense of liberty in conflict with Christianity and how is it in harmony with Biblical teaching?**

In *“Liberty in an Ancient Sense,”* Shelley explains that liberty originally meant living within a moral order, not doing whatever one pleased. Freedom assumed virtue, responsibility, and accountability. In contrast, after the French Revolution liberty increasingly meant freedom from authority—especially religious authority.

This modern idea conflicts with Christianity when liberty becomes autonomy from God. Scripture teaches that freedom apart from God is actually slavery to sin: *“Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin”* (**John 8:34**), but *“if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed”* (**John 8:36**). Liberty without restraint or consequences is not biblical freedom; it is bondage disguised as independence.

However, the ancient sense of liberty also harmonizes with Scripture when it recognizes moral order. The Bible presents true liberty as living according to God’s design. *“It was for freedom that Christ set us free”* (**Galatians 5:1**), yet that freedom is not an opportunity for the flesh (**Galatians 5:13**). James even calls God’s Word *“the perfect law, the law of liberty”* (**James 1:25**). In other words, obedience to God is not oppression but the pathway to real freedom.

Historically, the Roman Catholic Church reacted by building what Shelley calls a *“fortress,”* defending past authority structures rather than engaging modern ideas. The fall of the Papal States in 1870 symbolized the loss of its political power. This shows the tension between political liberty and ecclesiastical authority in the 19th century.

In summary, liberty is in harmony with Christianity when it means living rightly under God. It is in conflict with Christianity when it means freedom from God. True liberty is not the freedom to sin, but the freedom to live as restored image-bearers in Christ.

## Question 2

**Is there a sense in which the Church, we the followers of Christ, must reconcile ourselves to reality and reach agreement with modern civilization? What are the dangers we face in becoming more “tolerant” (forbearing) and what dangers do we face by not being more “tolerant”? Consider: Martin Luther wrote: “A Mighty Fortress is our God” not, “A Mighty Fortress is the church.” Also 2 Timothy 2:22-26.**

There is a sense in which the Church must recognize and engage the reality of modern civilization. We cannot pretend we live in another century, nor can we isolate ourselves from the world we are called to reach. However, reconciliation to reality does not mean compromise of truth. Martin Luther wrote, *“A Mighty Fortress is our God,”* not *“the church.”* Our security is not in defending structures or traditions, but in God Himself. The Church is not the fortress; Christ is.

**2 Timothy 2:22-26** gives needed balance. We are told to *“flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace”* and that the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but *“kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition.”* This shows that engagement with the world must be marked by gentleness and humility, not harshness or fear. Our goal is not to win arguments but that *“God may grant them repentance.”*

The danger of becoming more *“tolerant”* is that tolerance can slowly become compromise. If tolerance means accepting or affirming sin in order to appear loving, we lose our witness. We are ambassadors for Christ (**2 Corinthians 5:20**), called to live lives worthy of the gospel. We cannot become *“like the world”* in order to reach it. Love does not require surrendering biblical truth.

On the other hand, the danger of not being tolerant is becoming harsh, defensive, and fortress-minded. If we isolate ourselves or speak without gentleness, we misrepresent Christ. The early missionaries learned that they could not impose their cultural forms on others; the gospel must be distinguished from culture. Likewise, we cannot demand that unbelievers behave like Christians before they know Christ.

True Christian tolerance is not moral indifference; it is patient love. We are called to feed the poor, care for the widow, and show compassion (**James 1:27**). That is not compromise—it is obedience. Jesus summarized the law as loving God and loving our neighbor (**Matthew 22:37-39**). That love requires both truth and grace.

In summary, the Church must engage modern civilization with humility and gentleness, without surrendering biblical conviction. We must avoid compromise on one side and cold isolation on the other. God is our fortress; our calling is faithful, compassionate witness in the world.

## Question 3

**Take note of the definitions of “High Church” and “Low Church” above. Though they are connected with the Anglican Church originally, they are often used, in a general sense, to describe other denominations or churches. How would you describe your church? High or Low? Do you have certain ceremonies, traditions or rituals that must be done in your services?**

I would describe my church as more *“Low Church”* in emphasis. The central focus of our services is the expository preaching of God’s Word, which I believe should always be foundational. Our worship style is contemporary and expressive, sometimes focusing on what God has done for us, but we still seek to honor His greatness and love.

Although we do not follow elaborate rituals or formal liturgy, we faithfully observe the two sacraments Christ gave—baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Even as a newer fellowship, there is intentional effort to involve the whole congregation in using their spiritual gifts.

At the same time, I recognize that even Low Church congregations have patterns and expectations in their services. That structure is not wrong as long as it supports, rather than replaces, the authority of Scripture.

## Question 4

**Discuss the maintaining of balance in our mission with our worship, our devotion with our service. How easy is it to focus on one and neglect the other? How do we confuse the two? Should we consider them two separate issues?**

It is very easy to focus on either mission or worship and neglect the other. Some churches become so focused on serving and outreach that they neglect prayer, doctrine, and deep devotion. Others focus so much on worship services and Bible study that they forget Christ’s call to go into the world.

We also confuse the two when we assume that being busy equals being faithful. Service without worship becomes empty activity, and worship without mission becomes inward and self-centered.

I don’t think they are two separate issues. They are connected. Worship fuels mission, and mission expresses worship. Loving God and loving people go together (**Matthew 22:37-39**). The Church needs both to remain healthy and faithful.

**Chapter 39 - To Earth’s Remotest People – Protestant Missions**  
At the beginning of the 19th Century, Protestant Christianity scarcely existed outside of Europe and America. However, the 19th Century was the era of the greatest expansion of Christianity.

“Never had any other set of ideas, religious or secular, been propagated over so wide an area by so many professional agents maintained by the unconstrained donations of so many millions of individuals.” Kenneth Scott Latourette

How do we explain this sudden explosion of Protestant energy aimed at winning the world for Christ?

**The Pioneer in Modern Missions**  
William Carey (1761-1834) thought in terms of the evangelization of whole countries. He believed that the foreign missionary can never make more than a small contribution to the accomplishment of the work that has to be done, and that therefore the development of the local ministry (church) is the first and greatest of all missionary considerations. Above all, he saw that Christianity must be firmly rooted in the culture and traditions of the land in which it is planted.

## Question 5

**Why should we agree with William Carey’s philosophy, that the development of the local ministry (church) is the first and greatest of all missionary considerations? What other things do we sometimes make the priority? How do we reconcile this idea (of the local church as the priority) with the need to learn the language and culture, the need to translate the Bible and the need to provide for other needs?**

We should agree with William Carey’s philosophy because the local church is God’s primary instrument for making disciples. Mission work is not simply about individual conversions, but about establishing lasting, biblically grounded communities of believers. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) includes not only evangelizing but teaching and discipling. That happens most effectively through the local church. Carey understood that a foreign missionary can only do so much; the long-term strength of Christianity in any culture depends on trained local leaders and a healthy, self-sustaining church.

Sometimes we make other things the priority. We may focus primarily on statistics (number of converts), humanitarian aid, building institutions, or even the missionary personality itself. While those things can be important, they are not the end goal. If the local church is not established and strengthened, the work may not endure.

Reconciling Carey’s priority of the local church with language learning, Bible translation, and meeting physical needs is not difficult when we see those efforts as supporting the church rather than replacing it. Learning the language and culture is necessary so the gospel can take root deeply and authentically. Translating the Bible allows believers to be grounded in Scripture in their own heart language. Providing for physical needs demonstrates Christ’s compassion and opens doors for the gospel. These are not competing priorities; they are tools that serve the greater goal of planting and strengthening the church.

Carey’s confidence rested in the belief that if all people are commanded to repent (Acts 17:30), then the church must go. His emphasis challenges us to keep the church—not programs, not personalities, not statistics—at the center of missionary vision. The ultimate goal is not temporary influence, but a lasting, biblically faithful local body of believers.

## Question 6

**Discuss the objections raised against missions to heathen lands, as well as William Carey’s response. How does this challenge relate to us? How does it relate to “home” missions, as well as “foreign” missions?**

October 1792 – Carey, Fuller and eleven Baptist colleagues formed the Baptist Missionary Society, and within a year Carey and his family were on their way to India. The British East India Company and many of their representatives were not enthusiastic about missions. They were interested in profits and maintaining their free and easy lives, as well as their sense of racial superiority. They protested:

“(We consider) The sending out of missionaries into our Eastern possessions to be the maddest, most extravagant, most costly, most indefensible project which has ever been suggested by a moonstruck fanatic. Such a scheme is pernicious, imprudent, useless, harmful, dangerous, profitless, fantastic.” (Not meant in a good way).

Carey, Joshua Marshman, William Ward and their families labored for 25 years to organize a growing network of mission stations in India. They labored to understand all the intricacies of Hindu thought, this being one of the realms that are to be taken captive and brought into subjection to Christ. By 1824, Carey had supervised six complete and twenty-four partial translations of the Bible as well as publishing several grammars, dictionaries and translations of Eastern books.

**The Contagion of Missionary Service**  
The example of these men and their families prove to be contagious and stirred a multitude of others to follow in their example. In a large part, this passion to preach the gospel to the “heathen” sprang from the portions of Protestantism deeply influenced by the 18th Century evangelical revivals in England and America which revolutionized preaching and its objectives.

Two emphases led to the new Protestant world vision. The first was Evangelical, the belief that men are lost without faith in Christ and that the Lord commands believers in every age to make salvation known in the entire world. The second was Prophetic, the belief that the knowledge of the Lord would fill the earth and was preparation for the coming reign of Christ upon the earth, “millennialism.”

**Livingstone in Africa**  
David Livingstone arrived in South Africa in 1841 and served there for ten years but was drawn on by “the smoke of a thousand villages” that had never seen a missionary. His first journey, that made him famous, was through the jungles to the west coast in Angola and then, unwilling to desert the African carriers who had accompanied him – right across the continent to Quelimane (a seaport in Mozambique) on the east coast.

He sought to bring legitimate commerce (economic profit) to Africa along with Christianity, in order to help stamp out the slave trade as a means of obtaining wealth for Africans.

**Creation of the Voluntary Society**  
It became clear to British and American Christians that none of the traditional forms of church government would enable the church to embark on a world mission. Supporters of global evangelism were driven to find another form of cooperation. The voluntary society was created to meet a need rather than for theological reasons, but in effect it undermined the established forms of church government. They also made interdenominational action possible.

These Societies were based in various countries and focused on specific countries for outreach. One of the big issues that had to be addressed in this new method was: “What is the church supposed to look like?” To many, Christianity, in its Western form was Christianity. Too often what was exported was Western (British or American) culture, more than biblical mandates.

The London Missionary Society (1795) had as its fundamental principle: that our design is not to send Presbyterianism, Independency, Episcopacy or any other form of church government…but the glorious gospel of the blessed God to the heathen.

## Question 7

**Question: How much of our Christianity is cultural?**

**The Marks of Modern Christianity**  
Several key characteristics mark the expansion of modern Christianity. They would be that the worldwide expansion usually came by voluntarism not by compulsion, that the missionary movement tapped the wealth and talents of rank and file Protestants and that a wide variety of humanitarian ministries accompanied the widespread preaching of the gospel.

**Chapter 40 - The Destiny of a Nation – A Christian America**  
The vision of a Christian America was a dominant theme in 19th Century American Protestantism. The missionary zeal for foreign lands applied to their own.

The call was that Christians should seize the opportunity to shape the religious and political destiny of the nation. By the preaching of the gospel, the distribution of Bibles, the planting of churches, the establishing of schools, and the reform of American morals. A free society needed just laws, and in a democracy just laws required popular support informed by Christianity.

**The Challenge of the American West**  
At the birth of the United States of America, only five or ten percent of the American people were church members. By mid-century (1800s) half of the American people were west of the Appalachians. Evangelicals had two instruments available, the voluntary society and revival.

The voluntary society was used to exert influence upon public opinion, provide support for far-reaching missionary and educational activities and to spread reform ideals in the youthful nation.

God provided, in the Second Great Awakening (1790-1820) the next generation with skilled and dedicated leaders to regain the East and win the West.

**The Inflammable James McGready**  
July 1800 James McGready had his Pentecost and changed the course of American history, through “camp-meetings” (revivals).

By 1830 – Alexis de Tocqueville: “There is no country in the world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men.”

The Lutherans & Presbyterians felt that revivals slighted sound doctrine. Roman Catholics and Episcopalians considered them emotional eruptions, not true worship.

**Christianity Among the Slaves**  
At first, some owners strongly opposed teaching the Scriptures to the Negro. They feared that the slave might find in the Bible ideas of human equality that could incite him to rebellion. However, opposition declined as masters became convinced that the New Testament itself offered arguments in support of slavery.

During the first three decades of the nineteenth century the antislavery movement was stronger in the South than in the North. Evangelical sentiment against slavery in the North can be traced to the influence of the preaching of Charles G. Finney, the writings of Theodore Weld and Lyman Beecher’s daughter, Harriet Beecher Stowe in *Uncle Tom’s Cabin.*

**Cultural Shocks for Evangelical America**  
The counter-offensive against the Church, as it reached throughout the land, came in three shock waves. The First Shock was Charles Darwin’s *The Origin of Species.* If Darwin is right, how could the Bible be true? The second Shock was the increasing industrialization of American society and the rush to the cities. The Third Shock was the Higher Criticism of the Bible.

Taken together these were a part of the general shift in Western Culture from Christian to secular forms of thought and behavior. Christians disagreed about what actions they should take to meet the new challenges. “Public Protestants” chose to embrace the change as blessings sent from God and focus on Social Christianity, a Social Gospel and Social Service. However, “Private Protestants” chose to resist the changes as threats to the biblical message. Using the term evangelical, they stressed the need for individual salvation. The major urban revivalist during the generation following the Civil War was Dwight L. Moody.

**Chapter 41 - A Bridge for “Intelligent” Moderns – Protestant Liberalism**  
Lyman Abbott had been an influential minister in the 1890’s. Long before his 85th birthday in 1920, he had ceased to think of God as an “omnipresent policeman” and man as a “scared culprit.” The Western world had undergone too many changes and adopted too many ideas in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

**The Aims of Protestant Liberalism**  
Liberalism tries to make their faith meaningful in a new world of thought without distorting or destroying the gospel. Yet, in Liberalism, we have a God without wrath, who brought men without sin, into a kingdom without judgment, through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross.

Evangelical Liberalism and Modernistic Liberalism are like two ends of a suspension bridge; with the footing of one tower planted upon “modern thought” and the foundation of the other rests on “Christian experience.” The ground around both towers is shifting soil.

## Question 8

**Which is the safer side? It may seem like a dumb question, but it needs to be asked and it needs to be answered.**

Two technical theological terms are crucial. The first is “Immanence” which carries the idea of God dwelling in the world and working through nature. Extreme immanence is pantheism, which says that God is the world and the world is God. The second is “Transcendence” which implies the reality of God apart from the world. Extreme transcendence is found in the faith of the deists, for whom God is as separate from the world as a watchmaker from his watch.

**Enter Charles Darwin (1809-1882)**  
Too many wrestled with Charles Darwin’s books – *The Origin of Species,* was and *Descent of Man* trying to reconcile Biblical teachings with this new science. Liberals eventually sought to blend the Bible’s teachings, rejecting what did not agree with Darwin’s theories.

Biblical criticism comes in several forms. Lower criticism deals with problems of the text and tries to weigh the merits of many manuscripts of the Bible to find the earliest and most reliable text of Scripture. While Higher Criticism is not primarily interested in the accuracy of the text, it is interested in the meaning of the words and seeking to read between the lines to discover what really happened. They question who wrote it, when and what were their motives.

**The Impact of Biblical Criticism**  
More important than any of the details of biblical criticism was the fact that criticism threw doubt upon the belief the Bible is an infallible authority for Christian faith and practice.

Liberals welcomed higher criticism because they recognized a radically different view of the Bible was necessary for “intelligent moderns.” When liberals could no longer rest in the traditional doctrines of orthodoxy, which they felt science and history had destroyed, they found their needed assurance in the other pillar of their bridge: Christian Experience.

**Influential Spokesmen for Liberalism**  
Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) was a product of a pious Moravian home. He debated that the heart of religion was and always had been feeling, not rational proofs. He is considered the father of modern theology because he shifted the basis of the Christian faith from the Bible to religious experience.

Albert Ritschl (1822-1889) focused religious experience upon the historical Jesus. He maintained that the divinity of Jesus does not rest on the “questionable” things in the Bible, it rests on the fact that He is the source of a value-creating movement.

**An Example of Liberal Change**  
The New Theology was a protest in the interests of modern thought against the old theology of evangelical Puritanism (aka: New England Theology). Prior to 1880 most New England ministers held to the sovereignty of God, the depravity of mankind, the atonement of Jesus Christ, the ground of man’s forgiveness of sin; to the Holy Spirit as essential to conversion; and to the eternal separation of the saved and lost in heaven or hell.

After 1880, every one of these beliefs came under heated fire from the Liberals.

**Chapter 42 - Nothing to Lose but Chains – The Social Crisis**  
The Industrial Revolution is a term historians use for the rapid changes in European and American societies in the nineteenth century. Even in the so-called Christian West, few people see any connection between their religion and their employment.

**The New World of Factories**  
With the invention of the steam engine by James Watt (1736-1819) there was a breakthrough in productivity that helped drive the Industrial Revolution.

Life changed and relatively quickly. Gone was the rural or small-town life and pace. Working and living conditions in the city were harsh.

The Industrial Revolution greatly increased the wealth of mankind, but brought a host of evils for the workers massed together in the ever-expanding factories of European and American cities.

Men inside and outside the churches came to think of Christianity in narrower and narrower terms. Almost everything not obviously spiritual was left free from criticism. Thus, a growing body of industrial workers regarded the churches and the Christian message as largely irrelevant or powerless to speak to the difficulties they suffered in the age of the machine.

## Question 9

**Everything not obviously spiritual was left free from criticism, which means anything obviously spiritual was open to criticism. Why would that be the case? Because it wasn’t practical? It was not objective truth? It could not be “proven”? Are religious ideas the only ideas that should be open to criticism, questioned? Is this still true in our culture today?**

**Marx, the Prophet of the New Age**  
Into this era, Karl Marx (1818-1883) was born in the Rhineland of German-Jewish parents who had been converted to Christianity. He and his life-long friend, Friedrich Engles (1820-1895) published the famous *Communist Manifesto* in January 1848 and *Das Kapital* (1867-1894) which is said to be one of the most influential books of modern times. They were attempting to answer the great social ills associated with factories, oppressed workers, crowded living conditions and economic inequity.

After the middle of the 19th century, an increasing number of Christians worked zealously for improved conditions for laborers, through four avenues. They challenged the laissez faire philosophy in the name of Christian principles. They established Christian institutions to relieve the suffering of the poor and powerless. They supported the formation of labor unions and they appealed to the state for legislation aimed at the improvement of working conditions.

**Laboring Men in England**  
Nonconformists (such as the Methodists) were the main support for the laboring men in England, as well as the leaders in the temperance crusade and the founding of orphanages.

**Onward, Christian Soldiers!**  
William Booth (1829-1912) left the Methodist ministry to work with London’s poor. He preached in London’s streets in 1864 and met with phenomenal success. Within eleven years, he had thirty-two stations promoting evangelism and social service among London’s destitute.

No such ministry came from the Church of England. It was so wed to the past that it had great difficulty adjusting to the social crisis.

## Question 10

**Are we in danger of being “so wed to the past” that we are unable to minister in the midst of a social crisis? Do we have answers that are relevant, biblical and compassionate? What issues should we as the Church be addressing?**

**Social Gospel in America**  
The Liberals formed no organizations but chose to work through established denominations and political agencies.

The primary sign of change came in 1908 with the formation of The Federal Council of Churches. They adopted a “Social Creed of the Churches” that called for many benefits later American workers considered basics, such as, occupational safety, old age security, minimum wage and the rights of arbitration.

It was always possible to concentrate on the next life so much that Christians appeared insensitive to the pain of the present. The various Christian movements for social concerns always faced the danger of losing the church’s true mission. However, Christians cannot show their concern for people’s eternal destiny unless they also demonstrate their concern for people’s earthly needs. People do not care how much we know, until they know how much we care. If we are truly “heavenly minded” we will most certainly do earthly good. (**Matthew 5:16**)
