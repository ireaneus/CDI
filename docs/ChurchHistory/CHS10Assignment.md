bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**The Challenges of the Age of Progress – 1789-1914 AD**

- The French Revolution unleashed new hopes for the common person, just as science raised new questions for traditional Christians.
- Power seemed to be within the reach of the masses.
- For Christianity, this meant that new social unrest was added to the challenge of intellectual doubts.
- How are Christians supposed to meet the needs of the urban masses?
- Was man simply a product of evolutionary forces?
- Christians were seriously divided over ways to face these problems.
- Without the traditional support of the State, many Protestants turned to voluntary societies to minister to the poor and the oppressed, as well as to carry the gospel to foreign lands.

**The French Revolution**

- The supposedly firm ground of popular belief in the new era was the doctrine of human progress.
- The human race was getting better and growing happier – that was the new creed.
- The democratic gospel of the French Revolution rested upon the glorification of man rather than God.
- The Catholic Church recognized this and struck back at the heresy – as she had always done, trying to use her power. She saw more clearly than did most Protestant churches that the devil, when it is to his advantage, is democratic.
- Ten thousand people telling a lie do not turn the lie into truth.
- This is an important lesson from the Age of Progress for Christians of every generation.
- The Bible clearly teaches us, that the majority is often wrong.
- Inspired by the American Revolution, the sordid facts of what happened on July 14, 1789, were speedily transformed into the heroic deeds of the French Revolution.

**Liberty, Equality and Fraternity**

- Liberty, equality and fraternity were not only the call of the French Revolution; it was the spirit of the age.
- Augustine had taught, more than 1000 years before, that liberty comes by grace and not grace by liberty.
- Christianity understands that to be properly free man must be in a state of salvation, so throughout these centuries Christians had little enthusiasm for the idea of man’s improper, unchecked freedom. Here is another example of our need to keep balanced.
- The idea that everyone ought to be as free as possible was summed up in the statement: *“The liberty of each is limited by the liberty of all.”*
- In practice, this meant a constitutional government that guaranteed civil liberties to all, including the freedom to worship according to personal choice.
- This meant resistance to a return to monarchies (including a “pope-king”).
- By 1848 the liberal revolution had triumphed, at least temporarily, in almost every capital in Europe.
- Ironically, the year 1870 not only marked the end of the Papal States after 1,000 years; it also signified the declaration of the supreme authority of the Bishop of Rome and the doctrine of papal infallibility.

**The Fortress Mentality**

- One of the lessons the Church should learn from our history is the danger of a “fortress mentality.”
- Fortresses have a decided disadvantage.
- They grow stuff. They allow no enlargement of thinking and after a time you begin to imagine that the only world of any importance lies within the walls.
- Luther’s hymn is entitled: *“A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,”* not *“A Mighty Fortress is the Church.”* That is not a Biblical picture of the Church.

**Into the World**

- The evangelical movement in England, sparked by Whitefield and the Wesleys, moved the Church to fulfill our two-fold commission.
- God has sent His people INTO the world to proclaim salvation and to serve the needy.
- God has called his own FROM the world to worship and learn of Him.
- **Mission without worship can produce empty service, just as worship without mission can lead to careless religion.**

**Voluntary Religious Societies**

- Because of their freedom, Christians could form a variety of religious societies that were not churches in the traditional sense but involved Christians from various churches working together for some specific objective.
- Some Evangelicals were from “High Churches” with an emphasis on sacraments and the styles of rituals.
- Others were from “Low Churches” who considered the preaching of the gospel as most important.
- Each was loyal to their church but willing to work together for the fulfillment of the twofold commission.
- The Clapham Community, with William Wilberforce as their leader, is an example of one of these groups that tackled many issues by setting up organizations to work on a variety of causes. Among them were:
    - The Church Missionary Society.
    - The British and Foreign Bible Society.
    - The Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor.
    - The Society for the Reformation of Prison Discipline.
    - Their most famous effort was the elimination of slavery and the slave trade in England and its territories.

**The Era of Christian Expansion**

- At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Protestant Christianity scarcely existed outside of Europe and America, but the century proved to be a great era of Christian expansion.
- The Church Historian, Kenneth Scott Latourette said, *“Never had any other set of ideas, religious or secular, been propagated over so wide an area by so many professional agents maintained by the unconstrained donations of so many millions of individuals.”*
- William Carey was a most unlikely candidate to be considered *“The Father of Modern Missions.”*
- However, he was typical of those God chooses to accomplish His work, *“so that no man may boast before God.”* (**1 Corinthians 1:29**)
- He firmly believed that the foreign missionary can never make more than a small contribution to the accomplishment of the work to be done, and that therefore the development of the local ministry (the Church) is the first and greatest of all missionary considerations.
- Above all, he saw that Christianity must be firmly rooted in the culture and traditions of the land in which it is planted.
- Carey is included with a long list of missionary pioneers who gave their lives to cut the path for others to follow.
- This new passion to preach the gospel to the *“heathen”* sprang from those portions of Protestantism deeply influenced by the eighteenth-century evangelical revivals in England and America; which revolutionized preaching and its objectives.
- Christianity in this era, especially Protestant Christianity, had several characteristics that highlighted its expansion.
- First, the worldwide expansion usually came by choice not by compulsion. They advanced without state support or control and only by the power of persuasion.
- Second, the support for this movement came from the wealth and the talents of ordinary Protestants.
- Third, there was a wide variety of humanitarian ministries accompanying the widespread preaching of the gospel. Mission agencies established schools, hospitals and orphanages along with churches.

**Counter Attack**

- It is not surprising to see a counter-attack from the enemy as the Church advanced.
- In America, the Civil War and the moral issue of slavery along with the political issue of states’ rights consumed lives, wealth and energy.
- Before the nation could get back on its feet, Charles Darwin’s The Origin of the Species challenged the Church and the accuracy of the Bible.
- On a broader scale, the Church in England and America had to face a direct assault on the Scriptures in the form of higher criticism of the Bible, much of it from Germany.
- Higher criticism of the Bible involves the use of scientific techniques of literary criticism to establish the sources of the books of the Bible. Mostly its purpose was to discredit any idea supernatural revelation.
- Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albert Ritschl were the two most influential representatives for Liberalism – we will see them too often in our study of the History of Christian Doctrine.
- Then there was a cultural shift of increasing industrialization and a rush to the cities.
- Small towns became big cities almost overnight and the rural communities lost many of their young people and their workforce.

**The Industrial Revolution**

- With the Industrial Revolution, there was a rising tide of problems related to the crowding of cities, the influx of immigrants and the abuse of workers.
- Into this sea of misery two individuals waded – Karl Marx and William Booth. Marx offered a political solution (Communism) and Booth offered a spiritual solution (The Salvation Army) with a very practical application of compassion and help.
- It is always possible to concentrate on the next life so much that Christians appear insensitive to the pain of the present.
- The various Christian movements for social concerns always faced the danger of losing the Church’s true mission.
- However, Christians cannot show their concern for people’s eternal destiny unless they also demonstrate their concern for people’s earthly needs.
- I am sure you have heard the saying: *“People do not care how much you know, until they know how much you care.”*
- May we be faithful to present the love of God in our words and in our deeds.

**Review**

- The Church faced another set of new challenges in the Age of Progress:
    - The imbalance of the spirit of the French Revolution.
    - The temptation to retreat to our fortresses and bar the gates.
    - The challenge to fulfill the Great Commission and take the Gospel message and the demonstration of God’s love to the whole world.

**In the Next Session**

- We will discuss the seven chapters in The Age of Ideologies and the Age of Global Expansion and Relocation.

## Key Verses

- *“It was for freedom that Christ set us free”* (**Galatians 5:1**)
- *“Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin”* (**John 8:34**)
- *“if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed”* (**John 8:36**)
- *"For you were called to freedom, brethren"* (**Galatians 5:13**)
- *“the perfect law, the law of liberty”* (**James 1:25**)
- *"but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition"* (**2 Timothy 2:22-26**)

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE AGE OF PROGRESS**

For the rest of this session, have your student discuss what they have learned and written in their summary of each of the six chapters in *“The Age of Progress.”*

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters.

Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group. You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**  
Church History in Plain Language  
by Bruce Shelley  

**The Age of Progress – 1789-1914 AD**  
Christians saw new social unrest added to the intellectual challenges stemming from the rise of modern science. The French Revolution unleashed new hopes for the common man. Power seemed to be within the reach of the masses. How are Christians supposed to meet the needs of the urban masses? Was man simply a product of evolutionary forces? Christians were seriously divided over ways to face these problems. Without the traditional support of the State, many Protestants turned to voluntary societies to minister to the poor and the oppressed, as well as to carry the gospel to foreign lands.

## Question 1

**Read and discuss “Liberty in an Ancient Sense” on pages 374-375. How is this ancient sense of liberty in conflict with Christianity and how is it in harmony with Biblical teaching?**

In *“Liberty in an Ancient Sense,”* Shelley explains that liberty originally meant living within a moral order, not doing whatever one pleased. Freedom assumed virtue, responsibility, and accountability. In contrast, after the French Revolution liberty increasingly meant freedom from authority—especially religious authority.

This modern idea conflicts with Christianity when liberty becomes autonomy from God. Scripture teaches that freedom apart from God is actually slavery to sin: *“Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin”* (**John 8:34**), but *“if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed”* (**John 8:36**). Liberty without restraint or consequences is not biblical freedom; it is bondage disguised as independence.

However, the ancient sense of liberty also harmonizes with Scripture when it recognizes moral order. The Bible presents true liberty as living according to God’s design. *“It was for freedom that Christ set us free”* (**Galatians 5:1**), yet that freedom is not an opportunity for the flesh (**Galatians 5:13**). James even calls God’s Word *“the perfect law, the law of liberty”* (**James 1:25**). In other words, obedience to God is not oppression but the pathway to real freedom.

Historically, the Roman Catholic Church reacted by building what Shelley calls a *“fortress,”* defending past authority structures rather than engaging modern ideas. The fall of the Papal States in 1870 symbolized the loss of its political power. This shows the tension between political liberty and ecclesiastical authority in the 19th century.

In summary, liberty is in harmony with Christianity when it means living rightly under God. It is in conflict with Christianity when it means freedom from God. True liberty is not the freedom to sin, but the freedom to live as restored image-bearers in Christ.

## Question 2

**Is there a sense in which the Church, we the followers of Christ, must reconcile ourselves to reality and reach agreement with modern civilization? What are the dangers we face in becoming more “tolerant” (forbearing) and what dangers do we face by not being more “tolerant”? Consider: Martin Luther wrote: “A Mighty Fortress is our God” not, “A Mighty Fortress is the church.” Also 2 Timothy 2:22-26.**

There is a sense in which the Church must recognize and engage the reality of modern civilization. We cannot pretend we live in another century, nor can we isolate ourselves from the world we are called to reach. However, reconciliation to reality does not mean compromise of truth. Martin Luther wrote, *“A Mighty Fortress is our God,”* not *“the church.”* Our security is not in defending structures or traditions, but in God Himself. The Church is not the fortress; Christ is.

**2 Timothy 2:22-26** gives needed balance. We are told to *“flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace”* and that the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but *“kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition.”* This shows that engagement with the world must be marked by gentleness and humility, not harshness or fear. Our goal is not to win arguments but that *“God may grant them repentance.”*

The danger of becoming more *“tolerant”* is that tolerance can slowly become compromise. If tolerance means accepting or affirming sin in order to appear loving, we lose our witness. We are ambassadors for Christ (**2 Corinthians 5:20**), called to live lives worthy of the gospel. We cannot become *“like the world”* in order to reach it. Love does not require surrendering biblical truth.

On the other hand, the danger of not being tolerant is becoming harsh, defensive, and fortress-minded. If we isolate ourselves or speak without gentleness, we misrepresent Christ. The early missionaries learned that they could not impose their cultural forms on others; the gospel must be distinguished from culture. Likewise, we cannot demand that unbelievers behave like Christians before they know Christ.

True Christian tolerance is not moral indifference; it is patient love. We are called to feed the poor, care for the widow, and show compassion (**James 1:27**). That is not compromise—it is obedience. Jesus summarized the law as loving God and loving our neighbor (**Matthew 22:37-39**). That love requires both truth and grace.

In summary, the Church must engage modern civilization with humility and gentleness, without surrendering biblical conviction. We must avoid compromise on one side and cold isolation on the other. God is our fortress; our calling is faithful, compassionate witness in the world.

## Question 3

**Take note of the definitions of “High Church” and “Low Church” above. Though they are connected with the Anglican Church originally, they are often used, in a general sense, to describe other denominations or churches. How would you describe your church? High or Low? Do you have certain ceremonies, traditions or rituals that must be done in your services?**

I would describe my church as more *“Low Church”* in emphasis. The central focus of our services is the expository preaching of God’s Word, which I believe should always be foundational. Our worship style is contemporary and expressive, sometimes focusing on what God has done for us, but we still seek to honor His greatness and love.

Although we do not follow elaborate rituals or formal liturgy, we faithfully observe the two sacraments Christ gave—baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Even as a newer fellowship, there is intentional effort to involve the whole congregation in using their spiritual gifts.

At the same time, I recognize that even Low Church congregations have patterns and expectations in their services. That structure is not wrong as long as it supports, rather than replaces, the authority of Scripture.

## Question 4

**Discuss the maintaining of balance in our mission with our worship, our devotion with our service. How easy is it to focus on one and neglect the other? How do we confuse the two? Should we consider them two separate issues?**

It is very easy to focus on either mission or worship and neglect the other. Some churches become so focused on serving and outreach that they neglect prayer, doctrine, and deep devotion. Others focus so much on worship services and Bible study that they forget Christ’s call to go into the world.

We also confuse the two when we assume that being busy equals being faithful. Service without worship becomes empty activity, and worship without mission becomes inward and self-centered.

I don’t think they are two separate issues. They are connected. Worship fuels mission, and mission expresses worship. Loving God and loving people go together (**Matthew 22:37-39**). The Church needs both to remain healthy and faithful.

## Question 5

**Why should we agree with William Carey’s philosophy, that the development of the local ministry (church) is the first and greatest of all missionary considerations? What other things do we sometimes make the priority? How do we reconcile this idea (of the local church as the priority) with the need to learn the language and culture, the need to translate the Bible and the need to provide for other needs?**

We agree with William Carey’s philosophy because the local church is God’s primary instrument for making disciples. Mission work is not simply about individual conversions, but about establishing lasting, biblically grounded communities of believers. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) includes not only evangelizing but teaching and discipling. That happens most effectively through the local church. Carey understood that a foreign missionary can only do so much; the long-term strength of Christianity in any culture depends on trained local leaders and a healthy, self-sustaining church.

Sometimes we make other things the priority. We may focus primarily on statistics (number of converts), humanitarian aid, building institutions, or even the missionary personality itself. While those things can be important, they are not the end goal. If the local church is not established and strengthened, the work may not endure.

Reconciling Carey’s priority of the local church with language learning, Bible translation, and meeting physical needs is not difficult when we see those efforts as supporting the church rather than replacing it. Learning the language and culture is necessary so the gospel can take root deeply and authentically. Translating the Bible allows believers to be grounded in Scripture in their own heart language. Providing for physical needs demonstrates Christ’s compassion and opens doors for the gospel. These are not competing priorities; they are tools that serve the greater goal of planting and strengthening the church.

Carey’s confidence rested in the belief that if all people are commanded to repent (Acts 17:30), then the church must go. His emphasis challenges us to keep the church—not programs, not personalities, not statistics—at the center of missionary vision. The ultimate goal is not temporary influence, but a lasting, biblically faithful local body of believers.

## Question 6

**Discuss the objections raised against missions to heathen lands, as well as William Carey’s response. How does this challenge relate to us? How does it relate to “home” missions, as well as “foreign” missions?**

The objections to missions were that the distance was too far, the people too “barbaric,” the dangers too great, the cost too high, and the languages too difficult. Some also believed that if God wanted to save the lost, He would do it without human effort. Even the British East India Company mocked missions as reckless and unnecessary.

William Carey responded that obstacles did not remove responsibility. If merchants would cross oceans for profit, Christians should cross oceans for souls. Because God commands all people to repent (**Acts 17:30**), the Church must go. Carey proved his conviction by learning languages, translating Scripture, and planting lasting ministry in India.

This challenge applies to us today. We often use similar excuses—cost, fear, inconvenience—whether in foreign missions or “home” missions. James reminds us that *“faith without works is dead”* (**James 2:17, 26**). If we truly believe the gospel is necessary for salvation, we must act on that belief. Missions, whether across the world or across the street, require faith expressed through obedience.

## Question 7

**Question: How much of our Christianity is cultural?**

Some parts of our Christianity are biblical and unchanging, but other parts are clearly cultural. The gospel itself—Christ’s death and resurrection, repentance and faith—is not cultural. However, the way we worship, structure services, dress, use music, or organize church life is often shaped by our culture.

The expansion of modern Christianity showed this tension. Missions were carried out voluntarily, supported by ordinary believers, and often accompanied by humanitarian ministries. While this demonstrated compassion and obedience, it also sometimes exported Western culture along with the gospel. What was assumed to be “Christian” was sometimes simply British or American custom.

This challenges us to examine what is truly biblical and what is preference or tradition. The message of Christ must remain central, but it can take root in different cultures without losing its truth. The goal is not to spread our culture, but to spread the gospel.

## Question 8

**Which is the safer side? It may seem like a dumb question, but it needs to be asked and it needs to be answered.**

The safer side is not choosing either extreme, but holding both truths in biblical balance. God is both immanent and transcendent.

Scripture presents both realities. God is transcendent—He is eternal, infinite, Creator of time and space (**Isaiah 57:15; Psalm 90:2**). He stands above history and is not bound by it. Yet He is also immanent—He sustains all things (**Colossians 1:17**), knows the details of our lives (**Matthew 10:29-31**), and draws near to the brokenhearted (**Psalm 34:18**). He is not part of creation, yet He is actively involved in it.

The danger of modern liberalism was overemphasizing *immanence*, making God almost synonymous with human experience. The danger of rigid reaction against it can be overemphasizing transcendence, making God distant and abstract.

So the safer side is not a compromise, but a biblical definition: *God is both above creation and actively present within it. He is infinite and eternal, yet personal and near.* Christianity collapses if we lose either truth.

## Question 9

**Everything not obviously spiritual was left free from criticism, which means anything obviously spiritual was open to criticism. Why would that be the case? Because it wasn’t practical? It was not objective truth? It could not be “proven”? Are religious ideas the only ideas that should be open to criticism, questioned? Is this still true in our culture today?**

I think religion became easier to criticize during the Industrial Revolution because society began to value what was practical, measurable, and productive. Factories and science seemed “real” and useful, while spiritual truths were viewed as private opinions that could not be proven. Christianity was pushed into the personal sphere, while economics and industry were treated as neutral and unquestionable.

But religious ideas should not be the only ones examined. Every system—whether economic, political, or scientific—rests on assumptions about truth and morality. It seems unfair that faith is often singled out for criticism while other belief systems go unchallenged.

I see this same pattern today. Faith is often treated as subjective and outdated, while cultural values like success, autonomy, or progress are assumed to be objective. The challenge for the Church is to show that the gospel speaks to all of life, not just what we label as *“spiritual.”*

## Question 10

**Are we in danger of being “so wed to the past” that we are unable to minister in the midst of a social crisis? Do we have answers that are relevant, biblical and compassionate? What issues should we as the Church be addressing?**

There are many current crises—cultural confusion about identity and morality, political division, global instability, persecution of Christians, economic pressure, natural disasters, and widespread anxiety about the future. Many people without faith either ignore these realities or feel overwhelmed and hopeless. The Church cannot pretend these issues do not exist, nor can we retreat into a fortress.

At the same time, our answers must remain biblical and compassionate. Our hope is not in political alignment or cultural dominance, but in Christ. He is our rock, and our faith stretches back through history to the promises made to Abraham. That heritage gives stability, but it must also move us toward action. We are called to care for the suffering, speak truth about sin and redemption, defend the persecuted, and offer hope in uncertain times.

Looking to the past helps us avoid repeating mistakes, but we cannot live in it. The Church must hold firmly to timeless truth while applying it wisely and lovingly to present realities. If we do that, we will not be irrelevant—we will be faithful.

## **The Prophetic Viewpoint of the Church in Philadelphia 1648-1900AD (Revelation 3:7–13)**

In the prophetic (historicist) interpretation of the seven churches in Revelation, the church of Philadelphia represents a faithful, missionary era of church history—commonly associated with the period roughly between the 17th and 19th centuries. Notably, like Smyrna, Philadelphia receives no condemnation from Christ—only commendation and promise. Many interpreters observe a chiastic symmetry in the seven letters, with Smyrna and Philadelphia forming corresponding faithful churches in the pattern.

### **1. A Church Without Condemnation**

Unlike most of the seven churches, Philadelphia receives no rebuke. Christ offers only affirmation:

> “You have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.” (Rev. 3:8)

This parallels Smyrna (Rev. 2:8–11), another persecuted and faithful church. In the proposed chiastic structure of Revelation 2–3, these two churches stand as models of endurance and faithfulness amid opposition.

### **2. “An Open Door” – A Missionary Era**

One of the most significant statements in the letter is:

> “Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut.” (Rev. 3:8)

Prophetically, this has been understood to describe the unprecedented expansion of global missions during the 18th and 19th centuries. The rise of voluntary missionary societies, Bible translation efforts, and the spread of Protestant Christianity across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific closely resemble this imagery of divine opportunity. The missionary movement advanced not by political power, but by faith, prayer, and perseverance—“a little power.”

### **3. Faithfulness to the Word**

Christ commends them for keeping His word and not denying His name (Rev. 3:8). During the great missionary era, there was strong emphasis on biblical authority and evangelistic conviction. This was especially evident before the rise of theological liberalism in the late 19th century.

### **4. Endurance Under Opposition**

Philadelphia faced opposition from those who claimed religious authority but opposed the truth (Rev. 3:9). Though not described as undergoing intense martyrdom like Smyrna, they endured resistance and hostility. Missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries often faced disease, cultural resistance, governmental obstruction, and personal sacrifice.

### **5. Promise of Preservation**

> “Because you have kept My word of perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing…” (Rev. 3:10)

This verse is central in prophetic discussions. Some interpret it as a promise of spiritual preservation; others see it as foreshadowing deliverance from a future global trial. In either case, it underscores divine approval and protection.

### **6. Stability and Identity in Christ**

Christ promises:

> “I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God…” (Rev. 3:12)

To a church with “little power,” this promise of permanence, identity, and eternal security stands in contrast to the instability of earthly institutions.

### **Conclusion**

From a prophetic perspective, the church of Philadelphia represents a faithful, mission-oriented period of church history marked by:

- **Biblical fidelity**
- **Limited worldly power**
- **Global opportunity (“open door”)**
- **Perseverance under opposition**
- **No condemnation from Christ**

When compared to Smyrna in the chiastic structure of Revelation 2–3, both churches model endurance and faithfulness. Philadelphia especially reflects the great missionary expansion of 1648–1900, where the Church, though politically weak, was spiritually active and globally engaged.
