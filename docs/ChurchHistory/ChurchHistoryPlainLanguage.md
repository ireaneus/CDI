## Chapter 1 "Away with the King!"

**The Jesus Movement**

### Paragraph 1 - The Cross as the Center

The opening paragraph of this book immediately centers on **crucifixion**, setting the tone for understanding Christianity through the lens of the cross. This focus aligns with Scripture, where the meaning of such a death was established long before the Roman practice existed. **Deuteronomy 21:22–23** declares that *“he who is hanged is accursed of God,”* a statement written centuries before Christ and later applied directly to Him by Paul (**Galatians 3:13**). The cross, therefore, was not an accident of history but the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan. This explains Paul’s resolve to know nothing *“except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified”* (**1 Corinthians 2:2**) and his declaration that the cross alone is the believer’s ground of boasting (**Galatians 6:14**). From the outset, the book rightly presents the cross not as a secondary doctrine, but as the foundation of Christian faith and understanding.

### Paragraph 2 - Jesus and the Church

#### Scripture Support – The Early Disciples and Jesus’ Plan

**A simple band of followers, not yet the Church**

> **Luke 9:1–2**
> *“And He called the twelve together… and He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God.”*

> **John 17:6**
> *“I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world.”*

**Christ as the Founder of the Church (not yet fully formed)**

> **Matthew 16:18**
> *“I will build My church.”*

### One-sentence synthesis

The Gospels reveal that Jesus intentionally formed a simple company of followers, teaching them about life, the Kingdom of God, and the coming New Covenant, preparing them to carry on His work even before the Church was fully established.

### Paragraph 3 - Palestine in Jesus' Day

In Jesus’ day, the promised land was marked by Roman rule and pagan influence, creating deep resentment among the Jewish people. Centuries earlier, Israel’s prophets had promised deliverance from foreign powers and the establishment of God’s everlasting kingdom through a coming Messiah (Isaiah 9:6–7; Daniel 2:44; 9:25). As a result, several Jewish movements arose, each responding differently to Roman oppression: the Pharisees emphasized strict law-keeping, the Jerusalem aristocracy sought to preserve power, the Zealots longed for political revolution, and the Essenes withdrew to the wilderness in expectation of the Kingdom. The Jesus movement emerged within this climate but stood apart from all others. While many hoped for liberation from Rome, Jesus called for loyalty to a kingdom “not of this world” (John 18:36), carefully distinguishing His mission from political, religious, and revolutionary agendas as He revealed the true nature of God’s promised reign.

#### The Zealots and the Memory of the Maccabees

The **Zealots** were driven by a passionate longing for political and military liberation from Roman rule. Their hope was fueled by Israel’s history—especially the victory of the **Maccabees**, who, roughly two centuries earlier (c. 167–160 BC), successfully rebelled against Seleucid oppression and temporarily restored Jewish independence. To the Zealots, this period represented proof that God blessed violent resistance against pagan rulers.

By Jesus’ time, however, Roman power was far greater, and Zealot ideology increasingly merged nationalism with theology. They believed faithfulness to God demanded armed revolt, and that the Messiah would function as a warrior-king who would overthrow Rome. This expectation explains why crowds attempted to seize Jesus and make Him king by force (John 6:15), and why His refusal to endorse rebellion disappointed many. Jesus’ call to love enemies, submit to governing authorities, and take up the cross directly confronted Zealot hopes. His kingdom advanced not through the sword, but through suffering and self-sacrifice—an idea utterly foreign to revolutionary messianism.

#### The Essenes and the Dead Sea Scrolls

The **Essenes** represented a very different response to Roman domination and perceived corruption within Judaism. Rather than resist politically, they withdrew from society, believing Jerusalem’s priesthood and temple worship had become irredeemably defiled. Living in isolated communities such as **Qumran**, they devoted themselves to strict purity laws, communal living, and intense study of Scripture.

The Essenes are most famously associated with the **Dead Sea Scrolls**, a collection of biblical manuscripts and sectarian writings copied and preserved by their community. These texts reveal a people deeply concerned with covenant faithfulness and the coming Kingdom, expecting an imminent divine intervention to judge the wicked and vindicate the righteous.

While their devotion to Scripture is noteworthy, the Essenes’ withdrawal from society contrasted sharply with Jesus’ mission. Jesus did not retreat from sinners, cities, or corrupted systems; He entered them. He ate with tax collectors, healed on the Sabbath, and ministered in the very temple the Essenes had abandoned. The Kingdom He proclaimed was not reserved for a purified remnant hiding in the wilderness, but for those who would repent and believe—wherever they were.

#### What Jesus Had to Overcome Among These Factions

With these movements present, Jesus faced immense pressure to be misunderstood. Each group expected the Kingdom of God to arrive on *their* terms:

- The **Zealots** wanted political revolution and Roman bloodshed.
- The **Essenes** expected separation, judgment, and vindication from a distance.
- Other groups (Pharisees and elites) sought control through law or institutional power.

Jesus had to call people to allegiance without allowing His mission to be absorbed into any existing agenda. He proclaimed a Kingdom that was:

- **Not political** (John 18:36),
- **Not separatist** (Luke 19:10),
- **Not achieved by force** (Matthew 26:52),
- **Not rooted in legalism or status** (Matthew 23).

Instead, His Kingdom advanced quietly, spiritually, and paradoxically—through humility, obedience, and the cross. Maintaining this distinction required constant clarification, resistance to popular expectations, and ultimately led to His rejection and crucifixion. In a land filled with competing visions of deliverance, Jesus alone revealed the true nature of God’s reign.

### Paragraph 4 - Jesus Ministry

Jesus began His public ministry in the Judean wilderness at the Jordan River, near the place where Israel had first entered the Promised Land, signaling a new beginning in God’s redemptive work. Proclaiming, *“The time has come… the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news”* (**Mark 1:15**), Jesus announced that God’s promised reign was breaking into history. His days were marked by tireless travel—setting out at dawn, walking from place to place, and entering villages at nightfall to teach from the Scriptures in local synagogues. The central theme of His teaching was the Kingdom of God, revealed not merely in words but in power, as He declared, *“If I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you”* (**Luke 11:20**). As His popularity grew among the people, so did opposition from the Pharisees, who increasingly questioned His authority and credentials, exposing the growing divide between religious expectation and the true nature of God’s Kingdom revealed in Christ.

### Paragraph 5 - Jesus' Message

Jesus’ message consistently overturned common religious and political expectations. In the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector (**Luke 18:9–14**), He revealed that entrance into God’s Kingdom depends on humility and repentance, not religious status. From fishermen and tax collectors, Jesus chose twelve apostles—*“sent ones”*—who left their livelihoods to follow Him, forming a small but devoted community centered on His teaching and mission. Though crowds followed Him, Jesus affirmed that the Kingdom belonged to a *“little flock”* (**Luke 12:32**). After feeding the five thousand, when many sought to proclaim Him king, Jesus withdrew from the multitude and remained with the Twelve, refusing a crown rooted in popular expectation rather than God’s purpose. His mission was not to seize political power but to fulfill Scripture, coming first as the Suffering Servant foretold in **Isaiah 53** and the humble King who entered Jerusalem *“gentle and mounted on a donkey”* (**Zechariah 9:9**).

### Paragraph 6 - The Last week

During His final week, Jesus entered Jerusalem in deliberate fulfillment of prophecy, riding in humility as foretold by Zechariah, while the crowds cried *“Hosanna”* and laid their cloaks and palm branches along the road (**Zechariah 9:9; Matthew 21:8–9**). This public reception intensified expectations of revolt, especially as Jesus entered the temple and declared, *“My house shall be called a house of prayer,”* confronting corruption at the heart of Israel’s worship (**Matthew 21:12–13**). His words about the destruction of the temple and its restoration in three days echoed ominously among the people (**John 2:19; Matthew 24:1–2**), heightening political tension under Roman rule. The Sadducees, whose power depended on the temple and Roman favor, now found themselves threatened alongside the Pharisees, leading to an uneasy alliance against Jesus. As Jesus openly challenged Sabbath interpretations and exposed the inadequacy of human traditions (**Matthew 12:1–8; Mark 7:6–8**), the religious leaders sought a means to silence Him. In Judas Iscariot they found their ally, agreeing to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, fulfilling Scripture and setting the final events in motion (**Matthew 26:14–16; Zechariah 11:12–13**).

### Prophecy Behind the Triumphal Entry

**The King Himself**

> **Zechariah 9:9**
> *“Behold, your king is coming to you… humble and mounted on a donkey.”*

#### Significance of the Cloaks

**Cloaks = Submission to Kingship**

> **2 Kings 9:13**
> *“They hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him… and proclaimed, ‘Jehu is king!’”*

#### Significance of the Palm Branches

**Palms = Victory, Deliverance, and National Hope**

Palms were not random foliage.

They were historically tied to **national liberation**:

> **1 Maccabees 13:51** (historical background)
> Palm branches were waved to celebrate the **Maccabean victory** over pagan rulers.

By Jesus’ time:

- Palms symbolized **deliverance from foreign oppression**
- They expressed **messianic victory**
- They echoed the hope of **Psalm 118**

> **Psalm 118 25–26**
> *“Hosanna… Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD.”*

This is why the crowds cried **Hosanna**:

- It literally means **“Save now!”**
- It was a **messianic plea**, not mere praise

#### Why This Was So Dangerous

By combining:

- **Zechariah’s King**
- **Jehu’s coronation imagery**
- **Maccabean victory symbolism**
- **Psalm 118’s messianic cry**

The crowd was effectively declaring:

> *“This is the Messiah-King who will overthrow Rome.”*

That is why:

- Rome watched closely
- The Sadducees panicked (they protected the temple + Roman peace)
- The Pharisees feared loss of influence
- Jesus immediately went to the **temple**, not the palace

#### Why Jesus Did NOT Reject the Moment

Jesus **accepted** the symbolism — but **redefined it**.

- He **received** the praise **(Luke 19:40)**
- He **fulfilled** the prophecy
- But He **refused** to become a political Messiah

Instead:

- The donkey signaled humility
- The temple cleansing exposed corruption
- The cross would replace the throne

## Part 1: The Age of Jesus and the Apostles, 6 BC-AD 70

### Chapter 1 — “Away with the King!”

Chapter 1 presents Christianity as a movement born not in power or success but in rejection and suffering, centered on the crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus intentionally gathered a small group of followers and taught them about the Kingdom of God and the coming New Covenant while resisting every attempt to redefine His mission in political, nationalistic, or revolutionary terms. In a land shaped by Roman rule and divided Jewish expectations, He proclaimed a Kingdom marked by humility, repentance, and obedience rather than force or legalism. During His final days, Jesus deliberately fulfilled prophecy, reinterpreted the Passover around His own body and blood, and announced the arrival of the New Covenant promised by the prophets. His arrest, trial, and execution under the charge “King of the Jews” appeared to end the movement, leaving only a few grieving followers, yet this moment of apparent defeat became the true beginning of Christianity, establishing the cross as the foundation of the Church’s history and identity.

### Chapter 2 — “Wineskins Old and New: The Gospel to the Gentiles”

Chapter 2 explains how the Christian message moved beyond its Jewish roots and expanded to include Gentiles, fulfilling God’s broader plan of salvation. While the gospel first went to Israel, opposition and persecution pushed believers outward, spreading the message wherever they went (**Acts 8:1–4**). Peter’s encounter with Cornelius showed that God shows no partiality and that Gentiles could receive the Holy Spirit just as Jewish believers had (**Acts 10:34–48**). Paul’s missionary journeys further demonstrated that salvation was by grace through faith, not by keeping the Mosaic Law (**Acts 13:38–39; Acts 15:11**). The Jerusalem Council confirmed that Gentiles were not required to become Jewish in order to follow Christ (**Acts 15:19–20**). Jesus’ teaching about *“new wine”* requiring *“new wineskins”* illustrated that the gospel could not be confined to old religious systems (**Luke 5:37–38**), marking a major turning point in church history.

## Part 2: The Age of Catholic Christianity, 70-312 AD

### Chapter 3 — “Only ‘Worthless’ People: Catholic Christianity”

Chapter 3 describes how Christianity grew among people considered unimportant by Roman society and how a universal (*catholic*) church began to take shape. Early Christians were often poor, slaves, women, and social outsiders, yet the gospel appealed to them because it offered forgiveness, dignity, and new life in Christ (**1 Corinthians 1:26–29**). Believers formed close-knit communities marked by love, shared resources, and moral integrity (**Acts 2:44–47**). Though viewed as *“worthless”* by Roman standards, Christians believed they were chosen by God and valued as members of Christ’s body (**Ephesians 2:19–22**). As the apostles passed away, churches increasingly emphasized unity, shared belief, and recognized leadership to preserve the faith (**Philippians 1:1; Titus 1:5**). This developing catholic Christianity reflected the belief that there is *“one body and one Spirit”* united under Christ (**Ephesians 4:4–6**).

### Chapter 4 — “If the Tiber Floods: The Persecution of Christians”

Chapter 4 explains why Christians became convenient scapegoats during times of crisis in the Roman Empire. When disasters such as fires, plagues, or floods struck, Romans often blamed Christians for angering the gods because they refused to participate in pagan worship (**Acts 19:26–27**). Christians were accused of atheism, disloyalty, and hatred of society, even though they were taught to live peacefully and obey governing authorities (**Romans 13:1; 1 Peter 2:12–15**). Persecution varied by region and intensity, but suffering became a normal part of Christian life, just as Jesus had warned (**John 15:18–20**). Rather than destroying the Church, persecution strengthened believers’ faith and witness, as many rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for Christ (**Acts 5:41**). Their hope rested not in earthly security, but in eternal life promised by God (**Romans 8:18**).

### Chapter 5 — “Arguing about the Event: The Rise of Orthodoxy”

Chapter 5 explains how the early Church responded to **Gnosticism**, the most serious heresy of the second century, by clearly defining and defending orthodox Christian belief. Gnosticism taught that salvation came through secret knowledge (*gnōsis*), denied the goodness of creation, and often rejected the true humanity of Jesus, claiming that Christ only *“appeared”* to have a physical body. In contrast, the Church insisted that the gospel was rooted in real historical events, especially the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (**John 1:14; 1 John 1:1–3**). To guard the faith, the Church appealed to apostolic teaching preserved in Scripture (**2 Timothy 1:13–14**) and summarized these core beliefs in what became known as the **Apostles’ Creed**, which directly affirmed truths Gnosticism denied—such as God as Creator, Jesus’ real birth, suffering under Pontius Pilate, bodily resurrection, and the forgiveness of sins. By confessing *“the faith once for all delivered to the saints”* (**Jude 3**), early Christians established orthodoxy not as new ideas, but as faithful continuity with the apostles, ensuring that the Church’s message remained grounded in the historical work of Christ rather than in speculative or secret knowledge.

  Gnostics viewed salvation as escape from material existence.
- **Orthodox response:**
  Eternal life is **restored life with God**, not escape from creation (**Revelation 21:1–5; John 17:3**).

### **Why This Matters in Chapter 5**

Shelley’s key point is this:
The Apostles’ Creed was not written to be poetic or abstract — it was a **boundary marker**, protecting the Church from redefining Jesus, salvation, and reality itself. Orthodoxy arose not from speculation, but from faithfulness to **what actually happened**.

### Chapter 6 - The Rule of Books: Formation of the Bible

Chapter 6 explains how the early Church came to recognize which writings were truly Scripture, forming what became the Old and New Testaments. As Christianity spread, believers read the Old Testament in light of Christ, often using allegorical interpretation to see Jesus and the gospel throughout the Scriptures, a method especially developed by scholars like Origen. Differences emerged over which Old Testament books should be included, with Eastern churches favoring the Palestinian (Hebrew) canon and Western churches, influenced by Augustine, accepting the broader Alexandrian canon that included the Apocrypha—differences that continue between Protestant and Roman Catholic traditions. At the same time, the Church faced the challenge of identifying authoritative Christian writings, eventually recognizing the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. These books were accepted because they possessed a self-authenticating, transforming power, were widely used in worship, and were closely connected to the apostles or their immediate circle, as seen in the recognition of Paul’s letters as Scripture (**2 Peter 3:15–16**). Heretical movements such as Marcion’s rejection of the Old Testament and Montanus’s claims of new revelation forced the Church to clarify both the content and the limits of Scripture, affirming that the Holy Spirit inspired the writing of Scripture and continues to guide its understanding. This process culminated in the fourth century, when Athanasius and church councils formally listed the books already recognized by the Church, confirming the biblical canon as the enduring rule of faith.

### Chapter 7 - School for Sinners: A Structure that Fits

Chapter 7 explains how the early Church gradually developed structures to deal with sin, repentance, and restoration as the spontaneous work of the Holy Spirit gave way to the practical needs of an enduring community. In the apostolic age, the Spirit moved freely among believers, producing lives marked by moral transformation and holiness (**John 3:8**), a change so evident that even Roman officials and critics acknowledged the integrity and courage of Christians. The purity of Christian living and the faithfulness of martyrs powerfully testified to the truth of the gospel, often leading observers to embrace the faith themselves. However, persecution raised difficult questions about forgiveness, especially concerning believers who denied Christ under pressure, forcing the Church to wrestle with Jesus’ warnings about denial (**Matthew 10:33**) and the seriousness of apostasy. In response, the Church developed a structured practice of repentance and forgiveness, alongside baptism and the Eucharist, which came to be known as penance. Through this emerging system, administered by church leaders, the Church sought to balance holiness with mercy, becoming a “school for sinners” where forgiveness was offered without denying the cost of discipleship.

### **Chapter 8 — “Apostles to Intellectuals: Interacting with Other Worldviews”**

Chapter 8 describes how the early Church learned to engage thoughtfully with the surrounding intellectual and philosophical world while remaining faithful to the gospel. Jesus defined this balance by teaching that His followers are *“not of the world”* yet *“sent into the world”* (**John 17:16, 18**), calling the Church to live in tension between spiritual distinctness and active witness. The apostles warned believers against loving the world or adopting its values (**1 John 2:15**), recognizing that human wisdom often stood opposed to God’s truth. At the same time, figures like Paul understood that meaningful engagement was necessary, even though the message of the cross appeared as foolishness to Greek thinkers (**1 Corinthians 1:23**). Rather than withdrawing completely, Christian leaders learned to speak into existing worldviews, using language and ideas their audiences could understand, while still proclaiming a gospel that challenged prevailing assumptions. This chapter highlights how the Church began to move from simple proclamation to careful interaction, seeking to shine as light in the world without being shaped by it.

### Chapter 9 - Countries of the Sunrise: Early Christianity in Asia and Africa

Chapter 9 shows how Christianity spread beyond the Greco-Roman world into Asia and Africa, demonstrating that the gospel was not limited to one culture or region. From the beginning, Scripture anticipated this global reach, as Jesus commanded His followers to be His witnesses *“to the end of the earth”* (**Acts 1:8**). Christian communities took root in places such as Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and beyond, often adapting to local languages and customs while remaining faithful to apostolic teaching. Alexandria emerged as a major center of Christian learning, especially in Africa, while churches in the East developed strong missionary traditions. These regions produced influential leaders and theologians who helped shape Christian thought and practice. The growth of the Church in Asia and Africa fulfilled the biblical vision that people from every nation would come to worship the true God (**Isaiah 49:6; Revelation 7:9**), showing that Christianity was becoming a truly worldwide faith long before it gained acceptance in the Western Roman Empire.

## Part 3: The Age of the Christian Roman Empire, 312-590

### Chapter 10 - Laying Her Sceptre Down: Conversion of the Empire

Chapter 10 describes the dramatic shift of Christianity from a persecuted minority to the favored and eventually official religion of the Roman Empire, a change that brought both relief and serious challenges to the Church. After the brutal persecutions under Diocletian and Galerius, Emperor Constantine attributed his military success to the Christian God and extended protection and favor to Christians, gradually ending state-sponsored persecution. This alliance gave the Church freedom to worship openly and influence society, but it also altered the character of the Christian community. Where believers had once risked their lives to confess Christ, many now entered the Church for political advantage or social convenience, bringing lingering pagan beliefs and spiritual shallowness. As Christianity moved from persecuted to preferred and finally to mandated under Theodosius, the Church assumed moral responsibility for the empire but also surrendered something of its prophetic independence. Shelley emphasizes that in laying her sceptre down before imperial power, the Church gained security and influence, yet paid a price in compromised discipleship and blurred boundaries between genuine faith and cultural conformity.

1. **Discuss the parallels between the situation that Christians faced in Rome and those that we face in our culture today. See “Care for the Dying” (page 101). What were the advantages and disadvantages of Christianity becoming the State Church?**

**How are we to live in a culture increasingly doing what is right in its own eyes?**

Chapter 10 reminds us that the Church has lived faithfully in both persecution and cultural favor, and that neither condition guarantees spiritual health. Like believers during the reigns of Diocletian and Galerius, Christians today may feel pressure to conform or to retreat when culture turns hostile. Yet history shows that fear-driven compromise does not nullify genuine faith, just as Peter’s threefold denial did not disqualify him from restoration and service **(Luke 22:31–32; John 21:15–17)**. We are therefore called to live contrary to our culture not out of rebellion or self-righteousness, but out of love for Christ and a desire to please Him (2 Corinthians 5:9). Our response to injustice, moral confusion, and open hostility toward God is not retaliation, but faithful obedience, humility, and prayer—kneeling before the Lord and entrusting our fears to Him (**Philippians 4:6–7**). Chapter 10 warns that cultural approval can be as dangerous as persecution, reminding us that the Church’s strength is not found in power or protection, but in steadfast devotion to Christ, compassionate witness, and trust in God’s sovereignty even when society openly does what is right in its own eyes.

### Chapter 11 - Splitting Important Hairs: The Doctrine of the Trinity

Chapter 11 explains how the early Church was forced to clarify the doctrine of the Trinity as internal divisions threatened both the unity of the Church and the stability of the Roman Empire. Constantine, concerned that theological conflict could fracture the empire, urged church leaders to resolve disputes over the nature of Christ, especially the teachings of Arius, who claimed that the Son was a lesser being than the Father. While the Church recognized the Trinity as a mystery rather than a problem to be solved, it also understood that false teaching could not be ignored **(1 Corinthians 11:19)**. At the Council of Nicaea in 325, the Church rejected Arianism and affirmed that the Son is of the same essence as the Father, preserving the biblical witness to one God in three persons. Although emperors continued to interfere in church affairs after Nicaea, the chapter emphasizes that these debates were necessary to protect the truth of the gospel, reminding believers that some doctrines must be carefully defined, even if they stretch human understanding **(Deuteronomy 29:29)**.

### Chapter 12 - Emmanuel!: Christ in the Creeds

Who do you say that I am (Scripture - Matthew) You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God. Emmanuel God with us! “complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly man . . . in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division or without separation . . . coming together to form one person.”

**Christology**

The apostles spoke of “the image of the invisible God,” “the Word made flesh,” and “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.”
