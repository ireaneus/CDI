## Chapter 1 "Away with the King!"

**The Jesus Movement**

## Paragraph 1 - The Cross as the Center

The opening paragraph of this book immediately centers on **crucifixion**, setting the tone for understanding Christianity through the lens of the cross. This focus aligns with Scripture, where the meaning of such a death was established long before the Roman practice existed. **Deuteronomy 21:22–23** declares that *“he who is hanged is accursed of God,”* a statement written centuries before Christ and later applied directly to Him by Paul (**Galatians 3:13**). The cross, therefore, was not an accident of history but the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan. This explains Paul’s resolve to know nothing *“except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified”* (**1 Corinthians 2:2**) and his declaration that the cross alone is the believer’s ground of boasting (**Galatians 6:14**). From the outset, the book rightly presents the cross not as a secondary doctrine, but as the foundation of Christian faith and understanding.

## Paragraph 2 - Jesus and the Church

### Scripture Support – The Early Disciples and Jesus’ Plan

**Jesus’ plan for a company of followers to carry on His work**

> **Mark 3:14–15**
> *“And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach and to have authority…”*

> **Matthew 28:19–20**
> *“Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations… teaching them to follow all that I commanded you.”*

**He taught them about life**

> **John 10:10**
> *“I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.”*

> **John 6:68**
> *“Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.”*

**He taught them about the Kingdom of God**

> **Mark 1:14–15**
> *“Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.’”*

> **Luke 8:1**
> *“He was traveling from city to city and village to village, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God.”*

**He introduced them to the New Covenant**

> **Luke 22:20**
> *“This cup, which is poured out for you, is the new covenant in My blood.”*

> **Jeremiah 31:31** (foundation promise)
> *“I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.”*

**A simple band of followers, not yet the Church**

> **Luke 9:1–2**
> *“And He called the twelve together… and He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God.”*

> **John 17:6**
> *“I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world.”*

**Christ as the Founder of the Church (not yet fully formed)**

> **Matthew 16:18**
> *“I will build My church.”*

### One-sentence synthesis

The Gospels reveal that Jesus intentionally formed a simple company of followers, teaching them about life, the Kingdom of God, and the coming New Covenant, preparing them to carry on His work even before the Church was fully established.

## Paragraph 3 - Palestine in Jesus' Day

In Jesus’ day, the promised land was marked by Roman rule and pagan influence, creating deep resentment among the Jewish people. Centuries earlier, Israel’s prophets had promised deliverance from foreign powers and the establishment of God’s everlasting kingdom through a coming Messiah (Isaiah 9:6–7; Daniel 2:44; 9:25). As a result, several Jewish movements arose, each responding differently to Roman oppression: the Pharisees emphasized strict law-keeping, the Jerusalem aristocracy sought to preserve power, the Zealots longed for political revolution, and the Essenes withdrew to the wilderness in expectation of the Kingdom. The Jesus movement emerged within this climate but stood apart from all others. While many hoped for liberation from Rome, Jesus called for loyalty to a kingdom “not of this world” (John 18:36), carefully distinguishing His mission from political, religious, and revolutionary agendas as He revealed the true nature of God’s promised reign.

### The Zealots and the Memory of the Maccabees

The **Zealots** were driven by a passionate longing for political and military liberation from Roman rule. Their hope was fueled by Israel’s history—especially the victory of the **Maccabees**, who, roughly two centuries earlier (c. 167–160 BC), successfully rebelled against Seleucid oppression and temporarily restored Jewish independence. To the Zealots, this period represented proof that God blessed violent resistance against pagan rulers.

By Jesus’ time, however, Roman power was far greater, and Zealot ideology increasingly merged nationalism with theology. They believed faithfulness to God demanded armed revolt, and that the Messiah would function as a warrior-king who would overthrow Rome. This expectation explains why crowds attempted to seize Jesus and make Him king by force (John 6:15), and why His refusal to endorse rebellion disappointed many. Jesus’ call to love enemies, submit to governing authorities, and take up the cross directly confronted Zealot hopes. His kingdom advanced not through the sword, but through suffering and self-sacrifice—an idea utterly foreign to revolutionary messianism.

### The Essenes and the Dead Sea Scrolls

The **Essenes** represented a very different response to Roman domination and perceived corruption within Judaism. Rather than resist politically, they withdrew from society, believing Jerusalem’s priesthood and temple worship had become irredeemably defiled. Living in isolated communities such as **Qumran**, they devoted themselves to strict purity laws, communal living, and intense study of Scripture.

The Essenes are most famously associated with the **Dead Sea Scrolls**, a collection of biblical manuscripts and sectarian writings copied and preserved by their community. These texts reveal a people deeply concerned with covenant faithfulness and the coming Kingdom, expecting an imminent divine intervention to judge the wicked and vindicate the righteous.

While their devotion to Scripture is noteworthy, the Essenes’ withdrawal from society contrasted sharply with Jesus’ mission. Jesus did not retreat from sinners, cities, or corrupted systems; He entered them. He ate with tax collectors, healed on the Sabbath, and ministered in the very temple the Essenes had abandoned. The Kingdom He proclaimed was not reserved for a purified remnant hiding in the wilderness, but for those who would repent and believe—wherever they were.

### What Jesus Had to Overcome Among These Factions

With these movements present, Jesus faced immense pressure to be misunderstood. Each group expected the Kingdom of God to arrive on *their* terms:

- The **Zealots** wanted political revolution and Roman bloodshed.
- The **Essenes** expected separation, judgment, and vindication from a distance.
- Other groups (Pharisees and elites) sought control through law or institutional power.

Jesus had to call people to allegiance without allowing His mission to be absorbed into any existing agenda. He proclaimed a Kingdom that was:

- **Not political** (John 18:36),
- **Not separatist** (Luke 19:10),
- **Not achieved by force** (Matthew 26:52),
- **Not rooted in legalism or status** (Matthew 23).

Instead, His Kingdom advanced quietly, spiritually, and paradoxically—through humility, obedience, and the cross. Maintaining this distinction required constant clarification, resistance to popular expectations, and ultimately led to His rejection and crucifixion. In a land filled with competing visions of deliverance, Jesus alone revealed the true nature of God’s reign.

## Paragraph 4 - Jesus Ministry

Jesus began His public ministry in the Judean wilderness at the Jordan River, near the place where Israel had first entered the Promised Land, signaling a new beginning in God’s redemptive work. Proclaiming, *“The time has come… the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news”* (**Mark 1:15**), Jesus announced that God’s promised reign was breaking into history. His days were marked by tireless travel—setting out at dawn, walking from place to place, and entering villages at nightfall to teach from the Scriptures in local synagogues. The central theme of His teaching was the Kingdom of God, revealed not merely in words but in power, as He declared, *“If I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you”* (**Luke 11:20**). As His popularity grew among the people, so did opposition from the Pharisees, who increasingly questioned His authority and credentials, exposing the growing divide between religious expectation and the true nature of God’s Kingdom revealed in Christ.

## Paragraph 5 - Jesus' Message

Jesus’ message consistently overturned common religious and political expectations. In the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector (**Luke 18:9–14**), He revealed that entrance into God’s Kingdom depends on humility and repentance, not religious status. From fishermen and tax collectors, Jesus chose twelve apostles—*“sent ones”*—who left their livelihoods to follow Him, forming a small but devoted community centered on His teaching and mission. Though crowds followed Him, Jesus affirmed that the Kingdom belonged to a *“little flock”* (**Luke 12:32**). After feeding the five thousand, when many sought to proclaim Him king, Jesus withdrew from the multitude and remained with the Twelve, refusing a crown rooted in popular expectation rather than God’s purpose. His mission was not to seize political power but to fulfill Scripture, coming first as the Suffering Servant foretold in **Isaiah 53** and the humble King who entered Jerusalem *“gentle and mounted on a donkey”* (**Zechariah 9:9**).

## Paragraph 6 - The Last week

During His final week, Jesus entered Jerusalem in deliberate fulfillment of prophecy, riding in humility as foretold by Zechariah, while the crowds cried *“Hosanna”* and laid their cloaks and palm branches along the road (**Zechariah 9:9; Matthew 21:8–9**). This public reception intensified expectations of revolt, especially as Jesus entered the temple and declared, *“My house shall be called a house of prayer,”* confronting corruption at the heart of Israel’s worship (**Matthew 21:12–13**). His words about the destruction of the temple and its restoration in three days echoed ominously among the people (**John 2:19; Matthew 24:1–2**), heightening political tension under Roman rule. The Sadducees, whose power depended on the temple and Roman favor, now found themselves threatened alongside the Pharisees, leading to an uneasy alliance against Jesus. As Jesus openly challenged Sabbath interpretations and exposed the inadequacy of human traditions (**Matthew 12:1–8; Mark 7:6–8**), the religious leaders sought a means to silence Him. In Judas Iscariot they found their ally, agreeing to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, fulfilling Scripture and setting the final events in motion (**Matthew 26:14–16; Zechariah 11:12–13**).

## Prophecy Behind the Triumphal Entry

**The King Himself**

> **Zechariah 9:9**
> *“Behold, your king is coming to you… humble and mounted on a donkey.”*

### Significance of the Cloaks

**Cloaks = Submission to Kingship**

> **2 Kings 9:13**
> *“They hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him… and proclaimed, ‘Jehu is king!’”*

### Significance of the Palm Branches

**Palms = Victory, Deliverance, and National Hope**

Palms were not random foliage.

They were historically tied to **national liberation**:

> **1 Maccabees 13:51** (historical background)
> Palm branches were waved to celebrate the **Maccabean victory** over pagan rulers.

By Jesus’ time:

- Palms symbolized **deliverance from foreign oppression**
- They expressed **messianic victory**
- They echoed the hope of **Psalm 118**

> **Psalm 118 25–26**
> *“Hosanna… Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD.”*

This is why the crowds cried **Hosanna**:

- It literally means **“Save now!”**
- It was a **messianic plea**, not mere praise

### Why This Was So Dangerous

By combining:

- **Zechariah’s King**
- **Jehu’s coronation imagery**
- **Maccabean victory symbolism**
- **Psalm 118’s messianic cry**

The crowd was effectively declaring:

> *“This is the Messiah-King who will overthrow Rome.”*

That is why:

- Rome watched closely
- The Sadducees panicked (they protected the temple + Roman peace)
- The Pharisees feared loss of influence
- Jesus immediately went to the **temple**, not the palace

### Why Jesus Did NOT Reject the Moment

Jesus **accepted** the symbolism — but **redefined it**.

- He **received** the praise **(Luke 19:40)**
- He **fulfilled** the prophecy
- But He **refused** to become a political Messiah

Instead:

- The donkey signaled humility
- The temple cleansing exposed corruption
- The cross would replace the throne

## Chapter 1 Paragraph Summary

Chapter 1 presents Christianity as a movement born not in power or success but in rejection and suffering, centered on the crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus intentionally gathered a small group of followers and taught them about the Kingdom of God and the coming New Covenant while resisting every attempt to redefine His mission in political, nationalistic, or revolutionary terms. In a land shaped by Roman rule and divided Jewish expectations, He proclaimed a Kingdom marked by humility, repentance, and obedience rather than force or legalism. During His final days, Jesus deliberately fulfilled prophecy, reinterpreted the Passover around His own body and blood, and announced the arrival of the New Covenant promised by the prophets. His arrest, trial, and execution under the charge “King of the Jews” appeared to end the movement, leaving only a few grieving followers, yet this moment of apparent defeat became the true beginning of Christianity, establishing the cross as the foundation of the Church’s history and identity.
