bibleReference: Ephesians 4 (11-16) - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**The Age of Ideologies & Global Expansion**

- The 20th century brought great political and military struggles involving:
    - Imperialism
    - Communism
    - Nazism
    - Democracy
- The Church faced dangers from:
    - Persecution
    - Compromise
    - Secularization
- Protestants cautiously reached out to each other in movements of unity.
- Roman Catholics struggled to update their Church.

- In addition, the “new” Christianity in the Third World and Global South emerged and expanded at an astounding rate.
- The Global South describes the countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Everything from the equator south.
- More people have become Christians in the last one hundred years than at any other time.
- The great missionary push of the late 1800’s and early 1900’s has contributed to this explosive growth largely south of the Equator.
- Yet the new growth seems to have its own distinctive character and Spirit-given initiative.

**“Post-Christian North America”**

- Ironically, one-time strongholds of Christian mission in Europe and North America are seeing dormancy and decline.
- History will record if the new centers of Christianity in the Global South and beyond can maintain a faithful Christian character and give witness to this unprecedented work of the Spirit.
- Time will tell if signs of Spiritual stirring will revive a faithful witness in the West.
- Without the Spirit’s stirring the label “post-Christian” will become more fitting with time.

**The 20th Century**

- The 20th Century began with revival from Wales to South Africa, to China, to Korea and to North America.
- The First World War arrived and dampened the fire somewhat.
    - According to President Woodrow Wilson, this was to be the war to end all wars and make the world safe for democracy.
    - However, by the wars end, the Russian war effort had collapsed, along with its government and the Paris Peace Conference became an exercise in vindictiveness, effectively crippling Germany and setting the stage for the rise of Nazism.
- In Germany, the post-war Protestant clergy were monarchists, with no sympathy for socialism or democracy.
- However, the people were through with the monarchy and ready for someone to make Germany great again.
- The industrial workers came to hate a socially and politically reactionary church.

**The Nazis Rise to Power**

- As the Nazi’s rose to power, there was no organized campaign of resistance, by any of the major Church movements in Germany. Hitler courted Christian support by emphasizing national pride and pretending to favor the Churches’ role in the state.
- He blamed the Jews for destroying culture through capitalism, Marxism and even the Christian faith:
    - “The heaviest blow that ever-struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity’s illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew.”
    - It became clear that the dedicated Christian’s place in the Nazi world was no more secure than that of the Jew.

**The Communist Revolution**

- Meanwhile, the *Communist Revolution* in Russia was the other side of the totalitarian coin, *Nazism* being the right-wing version *Communism* being the left-wing version.
- *Marxism* viewed institutional religion (the Church) as a reactionary social force.
    - That only impedes progress toward the classless society.
    - It is something that must be smashed.
- The Russian Orthodox Church replied with defiance, declaring war on the state.
- In the first six years of the revolution, the State killed twenty-eight bishops and over one thousand priests.

**The Second World War**

- During the Second World War, Stalin realized the value of the Church’s contribution to public morale and granted them a measure of freedom to minister, primarily to women and children.
- Resistance to Hitler, by the German churches, was amazingly meager.
    - They were almost exclusively concerned with individualistic personal faith.
    - Traditional submission to the state.
    - A conservative outlook that rejected all left-wing proposals for social and political reform.
    - This enabled them to accept the Nazis’ claim to be the only alternative to Communism.
- Overall, World War II had a devastating impact on Christianity, both physically and morally.
- Thousands of churches were destroyed.
- Thousands of clergymen killed.
- Thousands of faithful believers persecuted or uprooted from their homes.

**The Evangelical Dilemma**

- The evangelical dilemma, in the age of ideologies, revolved around the fact that they offered millions of people a consoling, personal faith in the face of apocalyptic fears.
- But could they also lead America in another great awakening of social ideals?
- Evangelicals represented no single approach to America’s problems.
- The movement included:
    - Fundamentalists
    - Pentecostals
    - Charismatics
    - Conventional Conservative Protestants
- Many conservative Christians expressed dissatisfaction with the drift of fundamentalism between the two world wars.
- Most had no criticism of the doctrines of the movement, but they felt it had stumbled into the mire of anger, arrogance, negativity, legalism and especially a failure to apply basic Christian truths to crucial problems confronting modern man.
- In the 16th century, only four major divisions separated the churches of the Reformation:
    - Lutheran
    - Reformed
    - Anabaptist
    - Anglican
- By the 20th century, more than 200 denominations crowded the landscape in the United States alone.
- The Church had moved further and further away from centralization.

**The Ecumenical Movement**

- However, there was a movement in the 20th century toward a cooperative merger in unity and action.
- The biggest barrier to this Ecumenical movement was the issue of truth and doctrine.

**The Catholic Renewal**

- The Catholic Church also went through quite a change in the 20th Century with Vatican Council II.
    - It was the first council not called to combat heresy, pronounce new dogmas or marshal the Church against hostile forces.
    - Its purpose would be to “bring the Church up-to-date.” It was to be a pastoral council, not a doctrinal one.
    - They introduced new liturgy, using the language of the people. They discussed but did not fully answer the question:
    - Were some truths of the faith found only in tradition or were all truths of the faith found in Scripture?
    - The final session renewed the debate on freedom of religion. By accepting the decree, Roman Catholicism solemnly renounced in principle any use of external force against the voice of conscience; marking a radical break with a fifteen-hundred-year-old practice.
- Amid this upheaval, the Catholic Church experienced a major exodus of priests, brothers and nuns.
- From 1962-1974 there was a 31% decrease in the number of those preparing for the priesthood along with nearly 8,000 American priests leaving public ministry.

**The Church Today**

- Today after two thousand years, Christianity is the faith, at least nominally, of one-third of the world’s population.
- From a handful of early disciples, the faith has spread over the globe to claim the loyalty of nearly a thousand million inhabitants of our planet.
- In 1900, only 10% of the world’s Christians lived in the continents of the south and east, but a century later at least 70% of the world’s Christians lived there.
- More Christians worshiped in Anglican churches in Nigeria each week than in all the Episcopal and Anglican churches of Britain, Europe and North America combined.
- There were ten times more Assembly of God members in Latin America than in the United States.
- There were more Baptists in Congo than in Great Britain.
- More people in church every Sunday in communist China than in all Western Europe or North America.
- Surely, one of the more remarkable aspects of Christianity today is how few of these professed believers have ever seriously studied the history of their religion.
- The movement toward separation of church and state has all but removed religion from public education.
- However, even Christian education in many denominations has done little to give members any sort of adult understanding of the faith.
- Should we really be surprised, when today’s Christian so frequently blends gross errors with orthodox confession or defends some pagan practice as Christian conduct?
- In the past, torrid persecutions served to purge the household of faith.
- Heresy’s spread clarified the Church’s basic beliefs.
- In addition, the sudden appearance of barbarian hordes opened doors for further expansion.
- This ability to face new challenges and to tap the sources of renewal is one of the secrets of Christianity’s growth.

**Summary**

- The way forward usually meant a studied look backward.
- Baptized masses meant baptized pagans.
- Power corrupts; the Church gained the world but lost its soul.
- Jesus said it very clearly: *It is not to be this way among you!*
- We need to give a reasoned, biblical and humble response!
- In the midst of it all, we need to keep balanced!

**Review**

- The Lord is building His Church and the gates of hell will not stop Him.
- The Church has been through it all in the past sometimes responding well and sometimes not. We need to learn from the mistakes and wise choices of others.
- May we not find ourselves living in a *“post-Christian”* society.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will begin our study of The History of Christian Doctrines. We will begin with The Preface, The Prolegomena (proh-li-gom-uh-nuh) a prologue in text book or preliminary statements) and the Preparatory Doctrinal Development.

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: AGE OF GLOBAL EXPANSION & RELOCATION**

For the rest of this session, have your students discuss what they have learned and written in their summary of each of the six chapters in “The Age of Global Expansion and Relocation.”

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters.

Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group. You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**  
Church History in Plain Language  
by Bruce Shelley

**The Age of Ideologies: 1914**

The twentieth century brought the colossal struggles of political and military giants: Communism, Nazism and Americanism. A new paganism appeared in appeals to the laws of economics, the passions of race and the inviolable rights of individuals. Christians were forced to suffer, to think and to unite in new ways. Protestants reached out to each other in the movements of unity. Roman Catholics struggled to update their Church. The fall of the Berlin Wall signaled a decline in the power of ideologies. In addition, the “new” Christianity in the Third World and beyond emerges and expands at an astounding rate. This new Christianity eclipses inflamed Muslim voices in which it discerns both danger and call to mission.

**Chapter 43 – Graffiti on a Wall of Shame – 20th Century Ideologies**

A backward glance over the last two generations reveals the Christian message scribbled across the decades like so much graffiti, surrounded by other messages equally arresting and perhaps more demanding: Nazism, Marxism, and Capitalism.

Arnold Toynbee once suggested that the twentieth century marked the replacement of the great world religions by three post-Christian ideologies: nationalism, communism and individualism. They each assumed the character of a religious faith; each making ultimate demands –patriotism, class struggle or secular humanism; each with its sacred symbols and ceremonies, inspired writings, dogmas, saints and charismatic leaders.

World War I was the first time the world knew “total war” and on both sides of the battle lines people believed they were engaged in a righteous crusade. Woodrow Wilson declared that this was, “A war to end all wars and to make the world safe for democracy.”

The Russian war effort collapsed, in a revolution in November 1917 by the Bolsheviks (Communists) the militant, self-appointed vanguard of a new socialist society.

The Paris Peace Conference set the terms of peace, which proved to be a curious blend of naïve idealism and eager revenge. The Allies, sought a confession of guilt from Germany and to cripple the country for years to come. They succeeded and Nazism came about as a result of this vindictiveness.

Nazism was a right-wing version of dictatorial rule aka: “fascism.” Right-wing governments sprung up all over Europe and the Protestant Church in Germany lost millions of people to this new political religion.

The post-war Protestant clergy were monarchists, with no sympathy for socialism or democracy. The industrial workers came to hate a socially and politically reactionary church.

The distinctive Nazi traits were a rejection of the liberal ideals of the Enlightenment and the nineteenth century; along with magnifying a primitive, idealized past.

Hitler blamed the Jews for destroying culture through capitalism, Marxism and even the Christian faith: “The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity’s illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew.”

The dedicated Christian’s place in the Nazi world was no more secure than that of the Jew. Hitler courted Christian support by emphasizing national pride and pretending to favor the churches’ role in the state.

Catholics endorsed the new Nazi government and supported the agreement the Fuhrer signed with the pope in 1933, guaranteeing the freedom to practice the Catholic religion (which he never intended to fulfill) – though it excluded Catholics from German politics.

The German Christian Movement sought to unite the twenty-eight Protestant groups under one bishop and elected a fervent Nazi to that office. The Pastor’s Emergency League (aka “The Confessing Church”) set up an alternative church government. In between these two, were the timid majority of protestant ministers who eventually followed Hitler without protest.

In May of 1934, the Confessing Church adopted “The Barmen Declaration” (written mostly by Karl Barth), calling German Christians back to the central truths of Christianity and rejected the totalitarian claims of the state.

During the same troubled 20s and 30s, the Russian Bolsheviks (Communists) created another totalitarian system, a left-wing regime – with many of the same traits of Nazi Germany:

- dictatorial leadership,
- a single centralized party,
- ruthless terror,
- propaganda,
- censorship,
- a controlled economy and
- hostility to all organized religion.

Lenin (1870-1924) was the mastermind of the Russian Revolution (1917-1924) with violence as its chief weapon. He declared, “Institutional religion is a reactionary social force that only impedes progress toward the classless society and it must be smashed.”

The Russian Orthodox Church replied with defiance and declared war on the State. Riots in almost every city followed and in the first six years of the Revolution, twenty-eight bishops and over one thousand priests were killed.

**1. What is the difference between being “reactionary” and being “responsive”?**

I would tend to see reactionary as mostly emotional in its response. It would also tend to not have practical solutions to the problem and would be unwilling to work with others. Responsive would be the opposite approach.

The Marxists viewed “institutional religion” (The Church) as reactionary, an impediment and something that needed to be smashed. Perhaps from our view we might say, “Needs to be reformed”? Consider 2 Timothy 2:23-26 – How do we (individually and collectively) seek to deal with the social issues that we face in our culture? React? Respond? Ignore? What are some of the barriers to our involvement in finding a solution?

Apathy? A sense that people are simply reaping what they sow and this is God’s judgment on them? A fear of compromise or being accused of compromising? Or…?

The German churches’ resistance to Hitler was amazingly meager. They were exclusively concerned with individualistic personal faith, traditional submission to the state and a conservative outlook that rejected all left-wing proposals for social and political reform. This enabled them to accept the Nazis’ claim to be the only alternative to Communism.

In Russian, Stalin realized the value of the church’s contribution to public morale during the war and allowed them to set up their organizations again, collect funds and give some private religious instruction to their children.

Overall, World War II had a devastating impact on Christianity, both physically and morally. Thousands of churches were destroyed, clergymen killed and faithful believers persecuted or uprooted from their homes.

**Chapter 43 – Rootless Immigrants in a Sick Society – American Evangelicals**

The evangelical dilemma in the Age of Ideologies was that they offered millions of people a consoling personal faith in the face of apocalyptic fears, but could they also lead America in another great awakening of social ideals?

A revitalized evangelical Christianity was showing remarkable signs of new life. (This was partly due to the Welsh Revival that began in 1904 and spread around the world, including America. This is mentioned in this book in connection with the Azusa Street Revival in 1906.) This surprised many Americans who thought religion was supposedly confined to the “Bible Belt,” yet now, it was appearing all over the country.

However, Evangelicals represented no single approach to America’s problems. Most Evangelicals were conventional Protestants who held staunchly to the authority of the Bible and to orthodox doctrines. They believed in making a conscious personal commitment to Christ, known as the born-again experience.

Evangelicals could be compared to rootless immigrants in a new land. Only in this case, Evangelicals never crossed the ocean to experience the shock of a new land. They simply held their ground while the rest of the country changed.

In spite of the growth of the evangelical movement and its sudden visibility, it gave little evidence of reshaping the ideas and ideals of American culture. It had little impact in the government or the universities or the communication centers of the nation.

After The Civil War, many evangelicals turned to premillennialism, the belief that Christ’s return was imminent and that society would inevitably get worse before it occurred. Some believe that this is the root of the fundamentalists’ surrender of social concern.

**2. Do you think that the belief in Christ’s imminent return and that society would inevitably get worse before it occurred, is a source of our failure to have a positive influence on our culture? If so, why would that idea be adopted? Is it a proper response, or is it a reaction?**

Fundamentalism is usually dated from a series of twelve small books published from 1910 to 1915 containing articles and essays designed to defend fundamental Christian truths against the Modernist movement that questioned the authority and truth of the Bible. Many conservative Christians expressed dissatisfaction with the drift of fundamentalism between the two world wars. Most had no criticism of the doctrines of the movement, but they felt it had stumbled into the mire of some unfortunate emphases, especially their failure to apply basic Christian truths to crucial problems confronting modern man. (As well as their negativity?)

After World War II evangelical Christianity returned to public prominence in America, especially through the very successful and public ministry of Billy Graham. This included a strong emphasis of ministry to the youth in America.

Pentecostalism (in America) was sparked by a three-year long revival, beginning in 1906, at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. (Although it was really part of the Welsh Revival beginning in 1904).

The modern Charismatic movement crossed over into the Catholic Church as well as into non-Pentecostal denominations in the decades of the 60’s & 70’s. This reinforced the Evangelical movement, swelling their numbers, but made very little difference in the moral climate of America.

**Chapter 44 – New Creeds for Breakfast – The Ecumenical Movement**

In the 16th century, only four major divisions separated the churches of the Reformation: Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist and Anglican. Soon, however, a number of denominations appeared on the scene, most of them established by believers convinced of the importance of some particular teaching of Scripture. By the 20th century, more than 200 denominations crowded the landscape in the United States alone. The force within Christianity was centrifugal – away from centralization – often independent and sometimes divisive. However, another force, this one centripetal, drew Christians toward cooperation, merger and united action: “Ecumenism.”

Ecumenical means worldwide or universal. Applied to Christian churches, it implies the oneness of Christians in the faith, wherever they may be found. This unity can be seen as a spiritual reality or as an effort to create a merger of churches or of denominations.

The first significant effort in modern times to encourage cooperation among Protestants was the evangelical Alliance, organized in London in 1846. They sought to promote religious liberty and encourage cooperative activities but did not survive the century.

The Federal Council of Churches in America (1908) involved 31 denominations, but was criticized for its liberal theology by conservatives and was absorbed into the National Council of Churches of Christ in 1950. The World Council of Churches formed in 1948, in Amsterdam, was the most ambitious expression of ecclesiastical ecumenism.

The Life and Work Movement (1925) was like most of the other efforts. They compromised truth in order to try to gain unity. They rejected faith in the divine and human nature of Christ, stressed revelation as an ongoing process, said that true religion rests not on our conception of God but in our moral character. Religion is what a man is or what he does, not what he believes.

**Denominational Mergers (See charts 118-126)**

In the United States over 30 mergers of denominations were completed from 1900-1970. Some were reunions of church bodies that had split over such issues as the race question in the nineteenth century or groups from the same traditions that had immigrated to America from different countries.

The most persistent critics of ecumenism were the conservative Evangelicals (and the Fundamentalists). Their primary objections revolved around the inadequate doctrinal basis and an inadequate commitment to evangelism.

There were some efforts by Evangelicals and Fundamentalists to acknowledge unity and to establish a foundation for cooperative ministry. This included The National Association of Evangelicals and to a lesser degree the American Council of Christian Churches. They both were loyal to orthodox Christianity but differed in their structure and in their attitude toward conciliar ecumenism. Among Fundamentalists, the closest they came was the formation of The Independent Fundamentalists Churches of America (IFCA) and The General Association of Regular Baptists (GARB). These are not listed in the book.

Evangelicals turned to a series of congresses to encourage united effort in evangelism.

**The World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin - 1966**

The International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne – 1974

This produced the Lausanne Covenant. In it they affirmed the church’s visible unity in truth is God’s purpose. For two reasons:

- Theologically, the unity of the church is a gift of God through the Spirit, made possible by the cross of Christ (Eph. 2:14). Organic unions do not always maintain unity “in truth” (Eph. 4:13).
- Pragmatically, for visible unity in the truth, evangelism…summons us to unity. How can we preach a gospel of reconciliation and remain unreconciled?

**3. There are doctrines that we must defend and doctrines for which we must be willing to die. In any expression of unity, those doctrines that require our defense or death, must be part of that unity. What are those doctrines?**

Since your students have already taken the CDI class on Christian Doctrine, this should be review.

**Chapter 45 – The Medicine of Mercy – Roman Catholicism – Vatican II**

Pope Pius XII (1939-1958) – in 1950, decried the attempts of some theologians to update Church teachings and to weaken the significance of the dogmas…by seeking to free them from concepts and formulations long held by the Church and to return instead to the language of the Bible and the Fathers.

Vatican Council II (1962-1965) revealed a new spirit crying out for change in a system that nearly everyone assumed would never change.

Pope John XXIII was elected on October 28, 1958 and proclaimed his plan to convoke a council – Vatican II (1962-1965). Its purpose would be to “bring the church up to date.” It was the first council not called to combat heresy, pronounce new Dogmas or marshal the Church against hostile forces. It was to be a pastoral council not a doctrinal one. “The church must rule with the medicine of mercy rather than with severity.”

This was the largest gathering of church leaders for a Council ever. There were 2540 leaders attending from around the world. The conservatives who gathered saw the future as a threat to the past. The progressives were those who saw promise in the future.

**4. The conservative view of the future often sees it as a threat to the past and the progressive view sees the future as the promise of the future.**

When we are dealing with the truth of God’s Word and the mission of the Church, which view should be ours?

Both!? Reality check: Were the “Good Old Days” really good? Good compared to what?

The first session dealt with the central question: Were some truths of the faith found only in tradition or were all truths of the faith found in Scripture? They reaffirmed the validity and authority of tradition.

Pope John XXIII died before the second session and was succeeded by Pope Paul VI. The second session wrestled with how the whole company (college) of bishops related to the pope in the government of the Church. The pope remained as the absolute authority with the bishops as his advisers, if asked.

The third session wrestled with guidelines for the life and ministry of priests, the mission of laymen in the world and missionary work in non-Christian areas. The change here was dramatic as they introduce new liturgy, moved the altar forward and had the priests face the people. They also decreed that prayers were to be offered out loud and in the language of the people (vs. in Latin). They also encouraged connections between fellow worshipers by greeting one another with a “sign of peace.”

The final session renewed the debate on freedom of religion. By accepting the decree, Roman Catholicism solemnly renounced in principle any use of external force against the voice of conscience; marking a radical break with a fifteen-hundred-year-old practice.

Amid the upheaval, the Church experienced (and is still experiencing) a major exodus of priests, brothers and nuns. From 1962-1974 there was a 31% decrease in the number of seminarians in the United States; and between 1966-1972, nearly 8,000 American priests left the public ministry.

The Catholic Church faces two contrasting views of the Church. One sees the Church as a fellowship of spiritual communities held together by their recognition of papal supremacy. The second viewed the Church as a medieval super state, governed by an absolute monarch (the pope) who would and should impose its will upon its members and upon society.

Some found hope for the future of the Church in a new movement stressing personal Christianity – The Catholic Charismatic Renewal.

**The Age of Global Expansion and Relocation – 1900s**

More people have become Christians in the last one hundred years than at any other time. When focusing upon the evangelistic embrace of faith, it is arguable that more has happened in the last one hundred years than has happened in all of the church’s previous history. The great missionary push of the late 1800s and early 1900s has contributed to this explosive growth largely south of the Equator. Yet the new growth seems to have its own distinctive character and Spirit-given initiative. Ironically one-time strongholds of Christian missions in Europe and North America are seeing dormancy and decline. History will record if the new centers of Christianity in the Global South and beyond can maintain a faithful Christian character and give witness to this unprecedented work of the Spirit. Also, time will tell if signs of Spiritual stirring will revive a faithful witness in the West. Without the Spirit’s stirring the label “post-Christian” will become more fitting with time.

**Chapter 46 - Christianity in The West - Decline and Reconstruction**

The state of religion in the West is very uncertain. Opinions abound. Some believe that Christianity’s influence upon culture is a thing of the past. Many describe the West as “post-Christian.” Still others seem to think that the Evangelical church has won, in the sense that people today would identify Evangelical beliefs as “Christian,” as distinguished from liberalism. Others, fully informed about declining numbers, sense that North America is poised for another great work of the Spirit.

Contributing factors to the fading or passing of vibrant Christian faith include:

- An endless preoccupation with self-indulgent individualism that has eroded a sense of community and moral values.
- Affluence has given an ever-increasing standard to be chased. The haves and have-nots alike embrace this endless quest (Consumerism).
- Technology plays an increasingly greater role in our lives, providing individual, private, portable access to entertainment, information and instant social feedback or connection with other viewers. There is a globalizing effect of creating a common culture – for good and for evil.
- Some say, the church is to blame – for being only a reflection of the culture and not an agent of change.

A central notion for today’s understanding of secularization is that we can clearly distinguish what is religious from what is non-religious. In the West, the knowledge of God is thought to be an intellectual or academic venture that requires neither conversion nor even belief in God! In today’s world, secularism refers to movements that wish to eliminate or restrict the influence of religion; especially towards the State.

Hostile voices against religion see faith as not merely unnecessary but evil; these angry voices claim that religion is the root cause for most of the problems the world has faced (see Hitler, Marx & radical Islam). To be sure, the church has faced smarter atheists* (see chart in textbook pg.484); but the hostility of today’s atheists and secularists calls for the removal of religion and even the removal of Christianity from the public record. The description of western culture as “Christophobic” is not a serious exaggeration.

Perhaps as disturbing as the hostility to faith is an indifference to Christianity not only by opponents but also by adherents.

**5. Which is more disturbing: our culture’s hostility to the Christian faith, its indifference to Christianity or the indifference to Christianity (& the Church) by those who claim Christ? How many people do you know, who claim Christ but not His Church?**

Collectively, conservative churches have responded in three ways to the increasing secularism. The first approach was a speculative anticipation of the end of time, or at least the beginning of the end times. This led some to a conclusion that redeeming the fallen world was futile. Evangelicals have not abandoned this approach to the future, but they generally came to a sense that they had at least applied it in a dubious fashion.

The next approach was to battle secular forces on political and cultural turfs. Jerry Falwell, pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, established a political action group called: “The Moral Majority” and began to battle the influence of secular humanism. The battle lines were drawn primarily around three issues: abortion, homosexual rights and feminism. However, the control of the Panama Canal by the United States was somehow, included in the skirmishes.

The third approach involved another change of course or strategy. Many evangelicals sought to be less confrontational and more engaging with our changing culture, on its own terms. They created user-friendly churches that made religion almost totally a matter of personal choice, sort of a “smorgasbord” of truths where you can take what you like. A great variety of churches adopted a practical self-help approach, embracing a special version of allegory to extract techniques from the Bible, which suddenly became a manual for success in life. (Keep Balanced) The megachurch phenomenon, has at times, illustrated this approach of seeking relevance. Historians tend to view this development as another example of Americans’ privatization of faith.

Conservative evangelical efforts have not stemmed the tide of secularization. Conservatives could no longer look at church decline as a mainline or liberal church problem. Religious affiliation is at its lowest since 1930. Now one in five Americans claims to have no religious affiliation and for adults under the age of thirty, the number jumps to one in three.

Christians will face a still greater danger of infidelity to Christ if Muslims do not encounter the love of Christ in tangible witness and care.

As missions were exploding around the globe, Western Christians were beginning to struggle with the practice. Evangelical denominations and mission-sending organizations were facing budget cuts as churches and their members were not supporting these missions and missionaries.

**Chapter 47 - Shift to the Global South - What is the New Christianity?**

In 1900, only 10% of the world’s Christians lived in the continents of the south and east, but a century later at least 70% of the world’s Christians lived there.

More Christians worshiped in Anglican churches in Nigeria each week than in all the Episcopal and Anglican churches of Britain, Europe and North America combined.

There were ten times more Assembly of God members in Latin America than in the United States.

There were more Baptists in Congo than in Great Britain and more people in church every Sunday in communist China than in all Western Europe or North America.

The unmistakable first observation about the churches below the equator is that they are charismatic. (See chart page 498)

The “third blessing” approach acknowledged the first blessing of conversion and a second blessing whereby the believers were stirred and moved to sanctification or holiness. Additionally, they acknowledged a third blessing, which is Spirit baptism, which includes a special empowerment for service.

The first wave began through international revivals in Wales, India and Korea, then moved around the world including the United States in Azuza, California. This prompted the emergence of the major Pentecostal denominations that followed.

The second wave denotes a sweeping encounter and embrace of charismatic life spilling over into mainline Protestant denominations and Catholicism in the 1960’s and early 1970’s.

The third wave saw the embrace of signs and wonders by charismatics and some conservatives in the 1980’s.

The issue of attaching our culture to the gospel as we take it to the nations has always been an issue. The distinct character of North American Christianity is that it is a voluntary Christianity and less an expression of Christendom; though we certainly started out trying to establish a Christian nation.

**6. What are some of the things from our “Christian” culture that we might need to strip away before we pass it on to others? Style of music, clothing, schedule for church, etc.?**

The missionary vision usually included a vigorous effort to translate the Bible into the language of the nationals. Granted, the act of translation holds many opportunities to import cultural bias but the effect of translation was not cultural manipulation but became a boost for cultural independence. Several scholars have noted the centrality of biblical translation to the emergence of independent thinking.

Christians in the Global south seem to appropriate the Bible in a direct manner; they read with a sense of immediacy as though the Bible was written directly to them. Western readers, by contrast, often observe a historical distance between the world as they see it and the world of the Bible.

The Church has used three major approaches to understand what Jesus did for the human family to accomplish salvation:

- Evangelicals typically see Christ as our representative or substitute who died on the cross to accomplish salvation.
- Liberal Christians see the cross as a dramatic demonstration of God’s love, that when understood, overwhelms our reluctance to believe God loves us and awakens a response of love to God.
- The Eastern Church sees the atoning work of Jesus as addressing the bondage we experience as we face the oppressive evil of Satan and his demons, which we cannot defeat in our own strength.

**7. Which of these three approaches are true? Which of these three approaches should affect how we seek to reach people?**

All of them together. Consider the radical nature of our redemption.

Churches outside the West have a sense of solidarity that is hard for Westerners to grasp. We come from the most radically individualistic culture in history. (Even though we have a strong self-identification with sports teams.)

For most people in the world, the opposite is true: they believe their genuine identity is conveyed when they tell you the groups to which they belong. Certainly, this basic human need is perhaps a great opportunity for the church in the West.

Solidarity is visible at the gathered worship of the Church. There is a more vivid sense of encounter with evil for believers beyond the West. Christians in the Global South tend to embrace missions from their earliest days.

**Chapter 48 - Windows to the Christian World - Places and Persons of Faith**

“Generalizations are always wrong and usually helpful.”

When foreign missionaries were expelled from China in 1949, many wondered whether Christians would survive. There were suspicions that Christianity was merely a tool of Western imperialism. The church was weak, many in the church were nominally Christian and the ruling Communistic Party was very hostile towards religion.

The Protestants who cooperated with the Communists were called the Registered Church or the Three-Self movement. They took their name from an old missionary strategy that called for churches to be more self-reliant:

- Self-governing
- Self-supporting
- Self-propagating

The Protestants, who did not cooperate, were called the Underground Church, the house church movement or the unregistered Church. They risked life and limb to maintain independence. They generally viewed the Registered Church as traitors.

The Chinese government’s policy included brutal persecution and believed that isolating Chinese Christianity from Western influence would lead to its collapse.

The state has permitted free worship and the printing and distribution of Bibles. The lines of hostility are diminishing, with cooperation between the legal registered church and the unregistered churches becoming more typical. International churches have also found a footing in the country, serving Christians from other countries that live in China for work.

The number of converts in China is mind-bending. A conservative estimate for 2000 is 89 million believers, a full 7.1% of the Chinese population.

The Catholic Church has had a representation in China through these years as well. Ignatius Cardinal Kung became the first native-born Chinese bishop in Shanghai. He was imprisoned in 1955 for his unwillingness to renounce the pope and recognize the legitimacy of Chinese efforts to control the Catholic Church.

Korea had a Christian witness from the late 1700s and had the Scriptures in their own language in the 1800s, along with a great number of Protestant missionaries. The Welsh Revival in the early 1900s had a great impact on the Church and influenced the practice of praying simultaneously; with each believer praying aloud at the same time. In 1914 one in one hundred Koreans was Protestant. By 2010, one in three Koreans was Christian.

The East African Revival’s (1935 and on) geographic sweep moved from North Uganda to include Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania (was Tanganyika). The numbers defy our imagination. The percentages of Christian adherents near the end of the century were as follows:

    Uganda - 89%
    Kenya - 79%
    Rwanda - 81%
    Burundi - 90%
    Tanzania - 51%

The movement crossed denominational lines at numerous points. Brethren, Seventh Day Adventists, Mennonites, Baptists and Methodists all reported participation in the revival. In China, Korea and East Africa we observe several common elements. Each has an array of its own rich Christian cultures while having indebtedness to missionary efforts. Each has seen remarkable numerical growth. Each has produced believers who give glory to Christ in their bearing suffering and extending grace.

EPILOGUE - R.L. Hatchett

*“To be saved” in the Pauline view means to become part of the people of God, who by the Spirit are born into God’s family and therefore joined to one another as one body, whose gatherings in the Spirit form them into God’s temple. God is not simply saving individuals and preparing them for heaven; rather He is creating a people for His name, among whom God can dwell and who, in their life together, will reproduce God’s life and character in all its unity and diversity.* Gordon Fee

The unprecedented growth of Christianity in the last one hundred years requires reassessment. At present, both ends of Christian history profoundly speak in unison.  

- Are these new believers, in the global south and east, superstitious or naïve? Is their faith nominal? Can they break with their culture? (Can we break with ours?)  
- How could the Rwanda genocide happen on the turf of the East African Revival?

We rightly should also ask similar question of ourselves:  

- Is our practice of Christianity shaped or misshaped by our affluent culture?  
- What about Christian vs. Christian, in our Civil War?  
- Do we understand solidarity?

Reading church history rightly helps us read the Bible rightly; and reading the Bible rightly helps us read church history rightly.

- **8. Have you had any experience with the Church, or Christians, in (from) other countries? What did you see as their strengths and their needs?**

*Physically, Financially, Educationally, Spiritually, etc.*

**Bruce Shelley**

Today after two thousand years, Christianity is the faith, at least nominally of one-third of the world’s population. From a handful of early disciples, the faith has spread over the globe to claim the loyalty of nearly a thousand million inhabitants of our planet.

Surely, one of the more remarkable aspects of Christianity today is how few of these professed believers have ever seriously studied the history of their religion. The movement toward separation of church and state has all but removed religion from public education. However, even Christian education in many denominations has done little to give members any sort of adult understanding of the faith. Should we really be surprised, then, when today’s Christian so frequently blends gross errors with orthodox confession or defends some pagan practice as Christian conduct?

Torrid persecutions served to purge the household of faith. Heresy’s spread clarified the church’s basic beliefs. In addition, the sudden appearance of barbarian hordes opened doors for further expansion. This ability to face new challenges and to tap the sources of renewal is one of the secrets of Christianity’s growth.

The way forward usually meant a studied look backward, back to the image of God revealed in the story of Jesus.

- Baptized masses meant baptized pagans.  
- Power corrupts; the Church gained the world but lost its soul.  
- It is not to be this way among you!  
- Give a reasoned, biblical and humble response!  
- Keep Balanced!
