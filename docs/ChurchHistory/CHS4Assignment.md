title: Church History Session 4 - The Church as an Organization
date: 33 - 2000 A.D.
instructor: Russell Richardson
course: Church History
description: Know the basic structures of, and reasons for, church organization and government.
bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**Definition of the Local Church**

- Remember the definition Pastor Ken Ainsworth established for us in the Christian Doctrine class:
- *“The local Church (visible) is a group of believers called to assemble, worship and minister (serve) in a single community.”*
- The usage of the word *“ecclesia.”* In reference to a local church, carries with it the idea of organization for:
    - fellowship
    - worship
    - united effort, and
    - edification.
- Disciples were not meant to be disjointed, isolated individual particles but those who would meet in common faith and effort to carry out the great commission and strengthen one another.
- Paul writes to the Church at Corinth, in **1 Corinthians 14:40** – *“But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.”* (see also **Judges 17:6**, **21:25**; **Deuteronomy 12:8**)

**The Basic Systems of Organization**

- How were the churches in the New Testament organized to make disciples, to glorify God and fully enjoy Him forever?
- Before we try to answer that question, we need to look at the basic systems of organization that we have today.
- The present forms of church polity or government come from various interpretations of the New Testament’s teaching regarding the Church’s officers and their functions, as well as from tradition and culture.
- Much of what developed over the years has come, at least partly, through the confusion generated by designating the terms *“elder”* and *“overseer”* (or *“bishop”*) as two different offices rather than seeing *“elder”* as the title and *“overseer”* as the function.

**Different Forms of Church Government – By Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer**

- Biblically, we can describe the Church in numerous ways.
    - On one hand, we observe that the local church is a living organism—an expression of the body of Christ.
    - On the other, we know that the Church is an organization set up by Christ and regulated by the guidelines commanded throughout the Scriptures.
- As a divinely commissioned organization, God has ordained leadership to spur on:
    - growth,
    - purity,
    - outreach, and
    - holiness.
- Throughout history, these primary systems of church government have dominated the ideological spectrum of Christian leadership.

**Episcopal Government**

- As early as the Apostolic Father Ignatius (the Bishop of Antioch until the beginning of the 2nd century AD), solitary leadership structures flourished, and bishop-oriented churches spread throughout the Christian world.
- The church has frequently mimicked the political constructs of the presiding culture, with its strengths and flaws.
- Evidenced by the numerous writings of the Church fathers, solitary church leadership (also known as Episcopal Church government) strongly correlated with the Roman Empire’s leadership.
- As the emperor was supreme over the physical, the bishop/elder/pastor was supreme concerning the spiritual, presiding over all others (deacons and members).
- Episcopal-style churches still abound today, primarily throughout the Roman Catholic Church.
- While this form of government does prove efficient, corruption is always a danger, and the hierarchy and territorial aspects of this polity can be troublesome.

**Congregational Government**

- With a renewed emphasis on the priesthood of every believer, congregational church government has dominated the Protestant church.
- This form of church government, most often found in Baptist churches, usually maintains the presence and title of elders/pastors and deacons/trustees, but the power resides with the members of the congregation, who vote concerning yearly budgets, church programs, and leadership appointments.
- Divisiveness can be a negative result of this format, but the added accountability can stave off blatant corruption.
- (An interesting side note – is that we have many examples in the Bible to show us that the majority is often wrong. That is something to consider.)

**Presbyterian Government**

- One other popular system is the Presbyterian Church government.
- This simply means that the Church is led by the eldership (supported by the deacons).
- The church body may have limited say into the major decisions of the Church, but those who meet the biblical qualifications for leadership share the weight of power and responsibility.
- Though this system can foster a *“them and us”* attitude between the congregation and the elders, it produces a balanced level of efficiency and accountability.
- The church government described and commissioned in the early church was marked by a plurality of elders.
- Many churches maintain a system somewhat like a Presbyterian-style of church leadership because they believe that this structure is biblically preferable.
- They limit the structure to the local church only, using the terms elder and bishop interchangeably.
**Biblical Eldership**

- Another writer, Alexander Strauch, in his book: *“Biblical Eldership”* has some strong words about the problems he sees, that some forms of church polity have generated.
- *“Some of the worst havoc wrought to the Christian faith has been a direct result of unscriptural forms of church structure.”*

Only a few centuries after the apostles’ deaths, for example, Christian churches began to assimilate both Roman and Jewish concepts of status, power, and priesthood. As a result, church government was clericalized and sacralized.  
(this means priests and ceremonies began to dominate church life)

Under Christ’s name, an elaborately structured institution emerged that corrupted the simple, family structure of the apostolic churches, robbed God’s people of their lofty position and ministry in Christ, and exchanged Christ’s supremacy over His people for the supremacy of the institutional church.  
*“Biblical Eldership”* – **Alexander Strauch – page 101**

**The Need for Reformation**

The Church has always been, and in this world will always be, in need of reformation.

- The struggles with the world, the flesh and the devil put constant pressure on us, seeking to distract or discourage us from fulfilling our Lord’s commission. I am certain you saw that in your study of the seven churches of Revelation.
- There has never been a perfect church. However, one day the Lord will *“present to Himself the Church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless”* (**Ephesians 5:27**). Oh, what a day that will be!
- It is one of the most amazing things in history, to see that the Lord Jesus Christ has:
    - built His church through all of these years,
    - rescued fallen people and preserved His truth,
    - despite the failures of His followers, and
    - regardless of the form of the governmental structure.
- Make no mistake about this, He will continue to build, purify and reform His Church until He returns to take us to His Father’s house.
- Should we just abandon the idea of church government?
- Should we forget about trying to determine and implement a biblical structure of church government?
    - The answer to both questions is *“NO!”*
- In God’s Word we have, what I believe, are very clear principles for the structure and government of the local church.
    - Our thinking should be about long-term reform versus short-term fixes.
    - Our focus needs to be on making disciples and growing in maturity before we focus on structure.
    - If we do not have qualified leaders who are mature disciples of Jesus Christ, it will not matter how *“correct”* our form of government might be.
- We need to heed the words of our Lord:
    - **Mark 10:42–45** – Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, *“You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”*

For the rest of this session, you will spend time examining the passages in God’s Word that talk about who should lead in the Church, as well as what they should be doing.

**Review**

- There is a need for organization in the local church.
- There is a clear biblical structure, which also includes clear instructions as to the qualifications for those who should lead the Church.
- God has blessed churches regardless of their form of government.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will begin our study of the History of the Church called Introduction, Jesus and the Apostles and The Age of Catholic Christianity.
- We will begin to understand the great challenges the Church faced in its early years.

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE CHURCH AS AN ORGANIZATION**

Memorize **Ephesians 4:11–16**

**The Church as an Organization (The Local Church)**

**Definition:**  
A local church is an assembly of professing believers in Christ who have been baptized and who are organized to do God's will. *“A Survey of Bible Doctrine”* by Ryrie p.141, 142

The very idea of the local usage of the word *“ecclesia”* carries the idea of organization: for fellowship, worship, united effort, and edification. They were not to be disjointed, isolated individual particles but meeting together in common faith and effort to carry out the great commission and to strengthen one another.

1. Consider the need for structure and leadership from the following passages of Scripture

- **Judges 17:6; 21:25**
- **Deuteronomy 12:8**
- **1 Corinthians 11:17–19**

2. After reading about the various forms of Church Government (below), discuss the forms that you have experienced. What were the strengths and weaknesses that you have seen in the Church government you have experienced?

**Organization: Church Polity (Government)**

- The present forms come from various interpretations of the officers and their functions in the New Testament (plus traditions & culture).

**Hierarchical or Episcopal**

- From the Greek *“episkope”* – bishop or *“overseer”* – Hence, from or of the bishop; a government by bishops.
- In the Episcopalian form of church government, the archbishop (and there are several) has authority over the bishop who in turn presides over a diocese, e.g., several churches, which are cared for by the rector or vicar (pastor).
- The archbishop, bishop, and rectors are all ordained priests within the Episcopal system of church government.
- This form of government can be seen in the Methodist, Anglican, and in its most hierarchical form (i.e., many levels of bishops), in the Catholic church.
- Historically, there was no distinguishing between New Testament bishops and elders until Ignatius did so in the early second century.

Clearly, the hierarchical church is a post-biblical development.

**Federal or representative – Presbyterian & Reformed Churches**

Various denominations employ the Presbyterian form of church government where the local church elects certain elders to the “session,” (Presbyterian) or “consistory” (Reformed Church), some (or all) of whom are members of a higher governing body called the *“presbytery”* (Presbyterian) or *“classis”* (Reformed). Some of the members of the presbytery or classis are chosen by the presbytery or classis to form a synod. There is yet a higher governing body in the Presbyterian Church, referred to as the General Assembly which itself is composed of lay and clergy representatives from the presbyteries. The General Assembly may be responsible for churches in a region or country.

**Congregational – Baptists, Evangelical Free, Disciples, independent churches**

In the Congregational form of church government, both the autonomy of the local church (under Christ, however) and the rights of its members are stressed, through a democratic form of government. The conviction in this system is that there is no evidence in the NT that churches were controlled by other individuals or other churches. In fact, Paul told Titus to establish leaders in the churches from among the people in Crete (**Titus 1:5**). There is no mention that these leaders were responsible to outsiders for their budget or day-to-day practical considerations. The priesthood of believers is held in high regard in this system, though in most forms of this government, a leader or leaders are chosen (in extreme cases they are not), but they must in no way replace the ministry and involvement of the members.

Parenthetically, a distinction needs to be made here between modern day congregationalism and the form of congregationalism taught in the Savoy Declaration (1658) and the London Baptist Confession (1689). The framers of these Confessions held to a Presbyterian form of individual church government without the necessity of a broader court system.

**Benevolent Dictator**

There is another form of church polity, which is not official but is sadly too common. The (not so) *“Benevolent Dictator”* model. This can be seen in just about any form of Church government. The *“benevolent”* dictator can be the pastor/bishop or it can be just about any other person in the Church, including a group or family that is not *“officially”* in charge but is in reality. Sadly, they are rarely benevolent and they inoculate many against Christianity and the Church.

**Different Forms of Church Government** - by Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer (Reprinted with permission.)

Biblically, the Church is described in numerous ways. On one hand, we observe that the local church is a living organism—an expression of the body of Christ. On the other, we know that the Church is an organization set up by Christ and regulated by the guidelines commanded throughout the Scriptures. As a divinely commissioned organization, God has ordained leadership to spur on growth, purity, outreach, and holiness. Throughout history, three primary systems of church government have dominated the ideological spectrum of Christian leadership.

**Episcopal Government**

As early as the Apostolic Father Ignatius (the bishop of Antioch until the beginning of the 2nd century AD), solitary leadership structures flourished, and bishop-oriented churches spread throughout the Christian world. The church has frequently mimicked the political constructs of the presiding culture, with its strengths and flaws. Evidenced by the numerous writings of the Church fathers, solitary church leadership (also known as episcopal church government) strongly correlated with the Roman Empire’s leadership. As the emperor was supreme over the physical, the bishop/elder/pastor was supreme concerning the spiritual, presiding over all others (deacons and members). Episcopal-style churches still abound today, primarily throughout the Roman Catholic Church. While this form of government does prove efficient, corruption is always a danger, and the hierarchical and territorial aspects of the polity can be troublesome.

**Congregational Government**

With a renewed emphasis on the priesthood of every believer, congregational church government has dominated the Protestant church. This form of church government, most often found in Baptist churches, usually maintains the presence and title of elders/pastors and deacons/trustees, but the power resides with the members of the congregation, who vote concerning yearly budgets, church programs, and leadership appointments. Divisiveness can be a negative result of this format, but the added accountability can stave off blatant corruption.

**Presbyterian Government**

One other popular system is the Presbyterian church government. **As indicated below, this simply means that the Church is led by the eldership (who are supported by the deacons)**. The church body may have limited say into the major decisions of the Church, but those who meet the biblical qualifications for leadership share the weight of power. Though this system can foster a *“them and us”* attitude between the congregation and the elders, it produces a balanced level of efficiency and accountability.

*At the Moody Church, we maintain a system somewhat like a Presbyterian-style of church leadership because we believe that this structure is biblically preferable. Using the terms elder and bishop interchangeably, the Church government described and commissioned in the early church was marked by a plurality of elders (**Titus 1:5-7; Acts 11:30, 14:23, 20:17-18; Phil 1:1**). However, we must not insist that all other churches be like ours, but rather acknowledge the rich history and continuing value of churches which adhere to other systems of leadership.*

- The word *“episcopal”* is a derivative of the Greek word that translates into English as *“bishop.”* The use of this term should not be confused with the Episcopal denomination, a particular branch of Protestant Christianity that employs an Episcopal Church government.

** *“Presbyterian”* is a derivative of the Greek word for *“elder.”* Many churches, besides the Presbyterian denominations, employ a Presbyterian Church government.
Scripture: **Acts 11:30; Acts 14:23; Acts 20:17-18; Phil 1:1; Titus 1:5-7**

3. What are the qualifications for those who would lead the Church?

Compare the lists in **1 Timothy 3:1-13 & Titus 1:5-9** (see qualifications below) and discuss the barriers of becoming a qualified leader.

**Qualifications**

Consider the thought that the qualifications are not as much about an attainment and maintaining of a status but about direction, a goal for which you strive. Does that change your expectations of yourself or others?
**1 Corinthians 11:1; 1 Thessalonians 1:5-7**

How many churches openly sin by not intentionally developing leaders? How many objectively select leaders?

Paul solemnly tells us to develop leaders, because it guards the Church and makes ministry more effective.

Without a clear objective, a training program, and an impartial screening program that measures objective character and skill qualities, the Church has not taken seriously the charge to develop leaders.

All that is left is the *“good ol’ boy”* system, filled with favoritism and partiality. Real leadership development requires that we follow Paul’s instructions.”
Bill Hull in *The Disciple Making Church* pages 183-184

4. For further study and discussion, see the material below for information about church leadership.**

**Officers (local) mentioned in the New Testament (Elder, Deacon, Deaconess)**  
**Elder (central passages 1 Timothy 3 & Titus 1)**  

- Titles - **1 Timothy 3**  
- Overseer (“bishop”) - office and duty (Episcopos) overseer (**Acts 20:28**)  
- Elder - office and dignity (Presbuteros) (**Acts 20:17; Titus 1:5**)  
- Shepherd (pastor-teacher) - duty and concern and title (Poimaino) (**Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11; 1 Pet 5:1-4**)

Qualifications (summary term: blameless or above reproach)

- Personal (**1 Timothy 3:2-3; Titus 1:7-8**)
- Family (**1 Timothy 3:4-5; Titus 1:6**)
- Social (**1 Timothy 3:6-7**)
- Doctrinal (**Titus 1:9**)

Number -- difficult to determine, sometimes, whether its usage is singular or plural.

- There was more than one elder in each city and possibly more than one in each church.
- **1 Timothy 3:1-7** “Bishop/Elder” is singular
- **1 Timothy 3:8-13** “deacons” is plural
- **Acts 20:17** implies that there was more than one elder at each church (also **James 5:17**).

Duties: **Acts 20:28-31; Ephesians 4:11-12; Titus 1:9-11; 1 Timothy 3:1-7, 4:14, 5:17-22; Hebrews 13:7,17; 1 Pet 5:1-4**

- Shepherd (**1 Peter 5:2; Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11**)
- Preach & Teach (**1 Timothy 5:17; 1 Peter 5:2**)
- Preside, guide (**1 Timothy 3:5, 5:17; “rule”; Hebrews 13:17**)
- Protect (**Titus 1:9-11; Acts 20:28-31**)
- Be examples (**1 Peter 5:3**)
- Pray for sick, etc. (**James 5:14**)
- Handling of finances (**Acts 11:30**)

**Deacon (central passage 1 Timothy 3:8-13)**

Title – **Acts 6:1-7; 1 Timothy 3:8** – Helpers of elders; deacon – servant – *“diakonia”* – minister, service, and most of the time when without specific designation – servant.

Qualifications – **1 Timothy 3:8-13** – Similar to elders in addition to not being a gossip.

Duties:

- They are helpers to rulers and teachers – **Acts 6**
- No reference to teaching as a duty
- No reference to ruling in church

**Deaconess – Two possible passages for support.**

**Romans 16:2** – Phoebe – *“a servant of the Church”* possibly means a servant in an unofficial sense.

**1 Timothy 3:11** – *“wives”* or simply *“women”* possibly a *“deacon’s wife.”* Though there are *“qualifications”* for something; some think it is doubtful that such an office existed in the N.T.

Maybe the widows, not less than 60 years old, **1 Timothy 5:9-10**.

The New Testament seems to support most fully the idea of a plurality of elders at any one location (**Acts 14:23; 20:17; 1 Timothy 4:14; Titus 1:5; James 5:14; Hebrews 13:17; 1 Peter 5:1-2**), but not the idea of a developed hierarchical structure beyond this.

In **Acts 20:28** the same men are called *“episkopos”* (overseers) who were in **Acts 20:17** called “presbuterous” (elders).

The idea of leaders from various churches gathering in council to work out difficulties and doctrine is modeled in **Acts 15** and is seen in church history with varying degrees of success.

The very lack of any clear, rigid, complete outline of government is an indication that the Church was not to be a stereotyped legalistic body; but rather a spiritual body ruled as the Head sees fit. Most of the Doctrine we can build of church government in the New Testament must be illustrative rather than legislative. We may deduce how they organized but had room for much charity toward those who differ. **Ephesians 4:11-12**

There were three general officers serving the whole church, and not of any local appointment or election. They carried divine credentials, and were separated first by the Holy Spirit to their office. These were “first” apostles, “secondarily” prophets, then evangelists, lastly to these, may be added a fourth – the “teaching shepherds” who were given to the whole church, and not just locally since they could be called of Christ to change their field of labor. This list is given in **Ephesians 4:11**. The *“He”* is very emphatic in the Greek – *“He, Himself, and no other”* is the one who gives these officers to the Church.

**The Apostles – Personal delegates of Christ, Galatians 1:1**

The word Apostle means *“a personal delegate,” or “sent one.”* There is absolutely no record of any succession of this office to others. The two prime credentials of the office seem to have been: *“signs of an Apostle”* (special miracles) **2 Corinthians 12:12**; and having seen Christ in the flesh – so a personal commission from Christ in the flesh.

> **2 Corinthians 12:12** *"The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles."*

- Both are linked in **Hebrews 2:3-4**.
- **1 Corinthians 9:1** “Am I not an Apostle, have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?”
- **Revelation 2:2** shows Ephesus had tried those who said they were Apostles and were not.
- Others called apostles:
    - Barnabas (**Acts 14:14**)
    - Andronicus and Junias (**Romans 16:7**).

Along with the prophets they formed the *“foundation of the Church,”* (**Ephesians 2:20**), and are ranked first by Paul in every catalogue. From the many inferences, they carried the gift of inspiration in the utterance of God’s message and the writing of the New Testament. Since they were the chief part of the foundation, they were responsible for:

- The care of the churches (**2 Corinthians 11:28**).
- Personal superintendence and the authority of Christ (**1 Corinthians 5:4-5**).
- Founding and organizing of the churches (**Acts 14:23**).
- Formulating of the doctrine for the Church (**Acts 2:42**).
- Carrying the same inspiration as the rest of the Scriptures (**2 Peter 3:16**).

**Prophets**

Like the Apostles, there is no reference anywhere of their having been elected; they were called of God and given to the Church by Christ.

> **Ephesians 4:11**  
>
> And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers

In the book of Acts an ability to foretell the future marked many of the prophets (**Acts 11:27; 21:7-14; 23:10**). Silas and Judas were prophets (**Acts 15:32**).

> *"Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message. After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out. [But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]"*

They were (it was) a gift of the Holy Spirit (**1 Corinthians 12:28; Romans 12:6**). It seems more of a gift than an office, and covered more exhortation, edification and comfort than foretelling of the future (**1 Corinthians 14:3**). As a gift, it was temporary in nature – along with the gift of tongues & knowledge (**1 Corinthians 13:8**).

**Evangelists**

Among the most prominent in the New Testament was Philip (along with four daughters who were prophetesses) **(Acts 21:8-9)** and Timothy was instructed to do the work of an evangelist **(2 Timothy 4:5)**. They were distinctly given to the Church by Christ **(Ephesians 4:11)**. We could, in reading of **1st & 2nd Timothy**, arrive at a concept of an evangelist as:

- A delegate of the Apostle  
- Carrying His authority  
- As they carried His message and ministry  
- Where He could not be  

**Pastor/Teacher – Ephesians 4:11-12**

The Greek here is shepherds and teachers--equals *"Teaching Shepherds."*

- The words of Christ to Peter, *"Feed my sheep,"* **John 21:16**.  
- Linked with the admonition of Peter himself in his **1 Peter 2:2**.  
- *"Desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye might grow thereby."*  
- Paul's charge to Timothy, **2 Timothy 4:2** - *"Preach the Word."*  

These words for the pastor-teacher, give us the idea that there is but one food for the New Man - the Word of God. Therefore, it is necessary, for those who shepherd a flock, to see to it that the sheep get the right diet from the Word of God.

It is evident that in the early church, this pastor-teacher came from among the elders and there were a chosen number in each church. However, in any number of associated people, there must be a leader to take charge and keep order.

5. Consider the implications, for our leaders and ourselves, of the word pictures in **2 Timothy 2**.

In 2 Timothy 2 Paul uses seven different metaphors to describe the rigors of leadership. He pictures the minister as:

> The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to **teach** others also. Suffer hardship with me, as a **good soldier** of Christ Jesus. No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. Also if anyone competes as an **athlete**, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. The **hard-working farmer** ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.  
>
> Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a **workman** who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.  
>
> Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a **vessel for honor**, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.  
>
> The Lord’s **bond-servant** must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged

"Each of these images evokes ideas of sacrifice, labor, service and hardship. They speak eloquently of the complex and varied responsibilities of spiritual leadership. Not one of them makes out leadership to be glamorous."

*"The Master’s Plan for the Church"* – John MacArthur, Jr. page 15

*"Some of the worst havoc wrought to the Christian faith has been a direct result of unscriptural forms of church structure. Only a few centuries after the apostles’ deaths, for example, Christian churches began to assimilate both Roman and Jewish concepts of status, power, and priesthood. As a result, church government was clericalized and sacralized. Under Christ’s name an elaborately structured institution emerged that corrupted the simple, family structure of the apostolic churches, robbed God’s people of their lofty position and ministry in Christ, and exchanged Christ’s supremacy over His people for the supremacy of the institutional church."*

*"Biblical Eldership"* – Alexander Strauch – page 101

**Mark 10:42-45** - Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, *"You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."*
