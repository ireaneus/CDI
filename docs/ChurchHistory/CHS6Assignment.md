As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**Begin video.**

**In the Last Session**

- You learned the value of studying church history.
- You are now able to explain the extraordinary spread of the gospel in the age of catholic Christianity.
- You thought about and discussed the benefits and challenges in studying church history.

**Persecuted Minority to State Church**

- The movement that started the 4th century as a persecuted minority; ended the century as the established religion of the empire.
- Thus, the Christian Church was joined to the power of the state and assumed a moral responsibility for the whole society.
- Before we can understand the Church’s willing union with the State, we must look back at the Church’s rejection and persecution by the State.
- The intense persecution by Diocletian and Galerius ended when Constantine gained control of the empire by what he believed was the intervention of the Christian’s God through a dream.
- His victory was proof of the power of Jesus Christ and the superiority of the Christian religion.
- The move from persecuted, to favored, to official was gradual.
- Constantine ruled Christian bishops as though they were civil servants and pushed church leaders to resolve doctrinal controversies and maintain unity.
- Before Constantine’s conversion, the Church consisted of convinced believers who were willing to bear the risk of being identified as Christians, even at the cost of their lives.
- Now, many came who were politically ambitious, religiously disinterested and still half-rooted in paganism.
- This produced shallowness and pagan superstition, along with the secularization and misuse of Christianity for political purposes.
- By 380, the rewards for being a Christian gave way to penalties for non-Christians. Emperor Theodosius made belief in Christianity a matter of imperial command.
- Perhaps we should heed the words the English poet Samuel Butler – 1612-1680:
    - *“By this the fool commands the wise, the noble with the base complies …He that complies against his will, is of his own opinion still.”*
- Better still, we should pay attention to Jesus’ instructions to His disciples in **Mark 10:41-45**.
- Jesus points His disciples to the way that the Gentiles build kingdoms and then tells them, in verse 43 - *“But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;”*

**Church Councils**

- During this era and under the urging of Constantine, and other emperors, the Church met in Council to wrestle with the great doctrines of The Trinity and The Nature of Jesus Christ.
- The great merit of the creeds is that they left the mystery intact.
- Fifteen hundred years after the event we may wish for more understandable terms but we dare not say less than the Church said then.
- It is also important for us to remember **Dt 29:29** - *“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law.”*

---

**The Monastic Ideal**

- The Monastic Ideal was a natural development that echoes a Jewish saying: *“If you seek wisdom, go to the wilderness.”*
- There is a longing, born from our frustration with our own failure and the failure of those who are members of the Church to be truly committed, truly spiritual.
- In that longing for holiness and practical sanctification, we look for a path that will lead us to a *“more spiritual”* life.
- C.S. Lewis said, *“There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God.”*
- Luther, and others, condemned the Monastic Ideal because it encouraged the idea of two roads to God, a higher and a lower.
- This concept has plagued the Church in every generation.
- Why would we try to discourage a sold-out commitment to Jesus Christ?
- Because too often it is not a commitment to Jesus Christ; but a commitment to a false shepherd and a set of rules that are at best misunderstood and at worst distortions of the truth that lead to spiritual pride and alienation from the very people Jesus has sent us to bear witness to.
- It is an unnatural concept of the Christian life. There is only one way to God and that is through faith in Jesus Christ.

**Review**

- There is danger in being persecuted.
- There is danger in being the *“State Church.”*
- There is danger in *“trying to be more spiritual than God.”*
- God, in His sovereignty, used the Emperors to push the Church to deal with doctrinal differences.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will be discussing the seven chapters in The Christian Middle Ages.

## Key Verses

**Mark 10:41-45, Deut 29:29**

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE CHRISTIAN ROMAN EMPIRE**

For the rest of this session, you will spend time discussing what your students have learned and what they have written in their summary of each of the eight chapters in *“The Christian Empire.”* They will not only can share their insights, but they will also gain from the insights of their classmates.

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters. Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group.

You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**

*Church History in Plain Language*  
*by Bruce Shelley*

**The Age of the Christian Roman Empire – 312-590 AD**

The movement started the fourth century as a persecuted minority; it ended the century as the established religion of the empire. Thus, the Christian Church was joined to the power of the state and assumed a moral responsibility for the whole society.

**Chapter 10 – Laying Her Scepter Down – The Conversion of the Empire**

## Question 1

1. **Discuss the parallels between the situation that Christians faced in Rome and those that we face in our culture today. See “Care for the Dying” (page 101). What were the advantages and disadvantages of Christianity becoming the State Church?**

**How are we to live in a culture increasingly doing what is right in its own eyes?**

> Chapter 10 reminds us that the Church has lived faithfully in both persecution and cultural favor, and that neither condition guarantees spiritual health. Like believers during the reigns of Diocletian and Galerius, Christians today may feel pressure to conform or to retreat when culture turns hostile. Yet history shows that fear-driven compromise does not nullify genuine faith, just as Peter’s threefold denial did not disqualify him from restoration and service **(Luke 22:31–32; John 21:15–17)**. We are therefore called to live contrary to our culture not out of rebellion or self-righteousness, but out of love for Christ and a desire to please Him (2 Corinthians 5:9). Our response to injustice, moral confusion, and open hostility toward God is not retaliation, but faithful obedience, humility, and prayer—kneeling before the Lord and entrusting our fears to Him (**Philippians 4:6–7**). Chapter 10 warns that cultural approval can be as dangerous as persecution, reminding us that the Church’s strength is not found in power or protection, but in steadfast devotion to Christ, compassionate witness, and trust in God’s sovereignty even when society openly does what is right in its own eyes.

**Chapter 11 – Splitting Important Hairs – The Doctrine of the Trinity**

## Question 2

**2. Read and discuss this statement: Rejected Trinitarian Schemes (Pages 106-107) and Why is the Trinity Important? (Pages 111-112) (See also chart 28 and page 123 in textbook)**

> Attempts to explain the Trinity through natural analogies—such as an egg, water, or a plant—ultimately fail because they remove the personal nature of God and tend to slide into old heresies. These illustrations may help conceptually, but they distort the biblical teaching by reducing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to parts, modes, or impersonal forms. Chapter 11 shows that the Trinity is not a human invention but a doctrine drawn from Scripture, preserving both God’s oneness and the full personhood of each member of the Godhead. The Trinity is essential because it protects the gospel itself: the Father sends, the Son redeems, and the Spirit applies salvation. As **Deuteronomy 29:29** reminds us, there is a point where faithful theology submits to revelation, accepting mystery rather than reshaping God into something more understandable.
>
> As **Deuteronomy 29:29** teaches, God has revealed what we need to know about Himself, and those revealed truths belong to us. Scripture affirms that God is not partially known, since *“in Christ all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily”* (**Colossians 2:9**). The Trinity, therefore, is not a retreat into mystery but a faithful confession of what God has revealed—fully true, though not exhaustively comprehended.
>
> At the same time, Scripture also affirms that God has fully revealed Himself in Christ. Paul states clearly that *“in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily”* (**Colossians 2:9**), and that Christ is *“the image of the invisible God”* (**Colossians 1:15**). This means God is not partially revealed or obscured—He is truly and savingly known in Jesus.
>
> The tension, then, is not between revelation and mystery, but between revelation and exhaustion. God is fully revealed, but not exhaustively comprehended. We truly know God as He has made Himself known, yet we do not master or reduce Him to human categories. This is why the Church insisted on precise language in Trinitarian doctrine: not to explain God away, but to protect what has been revealed from distortion.
>
> So a stronger way to say it might be:
>
> God has revealed Himself fully and truly in Christ, but He has not revealed Himself exhaustively. What He has made known belongs to us—and it is enough.
>
> That keeps you grounded in biblical revelation, not philosophical mystery, and it aligns cleanly with the creeds without surrendering clarity.
>

**Chapter 12 – Emmanuel! – Christ in The Creeds**

- The Word Became Flesh is central to Christian worship

- J.S. Whale: *“A deep instinct has always told the Church that our safest eloquence concerning the mystery of Christ is in our praise. A living Church is a worshiping, singing Church; not a school of people holding all the correct doctrines.”*

## Question 3

**Question 3 — Is it “Either/Or” or “Both/And”?**

> The history of the creeds shows that the Church never viewed worship and doctrine as an either/or choice, but as a necessary both/and. True worship flows from a right understanding of who Christ is, and sound doctrine naturally leads believers to praise, not pride. As J. S. Whale observed, the Church’s safest language about Christ is often found in worship, yet this worship must be anchored in truth or it easily drifts into sentimentality or error. The Christological heresies forced the Church to clarify doctrine not to suppress worship, but to protect it—because a Christ who is less than fully God cannot save, and a Christ who is less than fully human cannot redeem humanity (**John 1:14; Colossians 2:9**). The creeds preserved this balance by setting boundaries rather than explaining away the mystery, allowing believers to sing, confess, and adore the true Christ while remaining faithful to apostolic teaching (**1 Corinthians 11:19; Deuteronomy 29:29**). Therefore, Christian faith is strongest when worship and doctrine remain united, as loving God with heart and mind together guards the Church from error and deepens devotion to Christ.

**4. Discuss the major heresies about Christ – page 123 in textbook & Chart 26.**

Major heresies about Christ forced the churches to clarify: *“Who is Jesus Christ?”* (**1 Corinthians 11:19**) They also forced the churches to establish the boundaries of truth!

- Apollinarian = Only the body represented Christ’s human nature  
  - rejected @ 2nd Council @ Constantinople – 381

- Nestorius = the merging of wills vs. an essential union – mostly misunderstood = rejected at Council of Ephesus 431

- Eutyches = “monophisitism” defended the one nature of Christ, combining the two so intimately that the human nature was absorbed completely, lost and dissolved by the divine nature.  
  - rejected @ 4th Council @ Chalcedon – 451

In the Chalcedonian statement, the churches declared: In Jesus Christ, true deity (against Arius) and full humanity (against Apollinaris) are indivisibly united in One Person (against Nestorius) without being confused (against Eutyches).

To state it another way: So, against Arius the church affirmed that Jesus was truly God, and against Apollinaris, that He was truly man. Against Eutyches it confessed that Jesus’ deity and humanity were not changed into something else, and against Nestorius, that Jesus was not divided but one person.

The merit of the Chalcedonian statement lies in the boundaries it established. In effect, it erected a fence and said: *“Within this lies the mystery of the God-man.”*

Fifteen hundred years after the event we may wish for more understandable terms, but we dare not say less than the church said then.

**Chapter 13 – Exiles from Life – The Beginnings of Monasticism**

## Question 5

**5. What are some ways that the church today may be exiles from life? What are our motivations? What do we hope to gain? What are the pitfalls?**

> In many ways, the church today has become increasingly *exiled from life*, especially since COVID, by retreating into safe and controlled spaces rather than engaging the world with the gospel. Church life is often confined to a building and limited to scheduled gatherings, with worship and the interpretation of Scripture centered almost exclusively on Sundays. While corporate worship and teaching are essential, the Church was commissioned to *“go into all the world and preach the gospel”* (**Matthew 28:19–20**), not to remain contained within its own walls. When the Church becomes inward-focused, it risks functioning more as a refuge from the world than as a witness to it.
>
>The motivation behind this exile is often rooted in fear and deception. There is a desire to feel safe, protected, and affirmed, and the enemy exploits this by encouraging exclusivity that quietly sidelines the Great Commission. While community, love, peace, and the practice of the biblical *“one anothers”* are genuine goods the Church hopes to gain, they can become substitutes for mission rather than fuel for it. As **Colossians 2:18–23** warns, practices that appear spiritual can lose their power when they are detached from Christ’s purpose, becoming inward, self-protective, and ultimately ineffective.
>
>The primary pitfall is that disciple-making is replaced with information-sharing. We trade the joy of making disciples for the comfort of *rightly dividing the word* in isolation, forgetting that Scripture was given to be lived out and proclaimed. A proper balance is needed: the gospel must be presented accurately to avoid cheap grace and easy believism, yet it must also be carried outward in obedience to Christ. We are not called merely to make converts, but disciples—people whom God is already drawing to Himself—training them both in faithful living and in correctly handling the Word of truth. True maturity is found not in exile from life, but in faithful engagement with it for the glory of God.

**Chapter 14 – The Sage of The Ages – Augustine**

## Modern Semi-Pelagianism

Modern *semi-Pelagianism* is widespread in the contemporary church, often affirming the language of human fallenness while quietly preserving human autonomy at the decisive moment of salvation. While Scripture teaches that all humanity is truly *“in Adam”* and spiritually dead apart from grace (**Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:1–3**), semi-Pelagianism reframes this condition as moral weakness rather than total inability, allowing faith to function as an unfallen human capacity. God’s grace is said to enable salvation, yet the final determination is placed in the human will, with election reduced to divine foreknowledge of human choice. This stands in contrast to the consistent biblical pattern in which God initiates, calls, and appoints—Abraham is called (**Genesis 12:1**), Mary is chosen (**Luke 1:30**), the disciples are commanded (*“You did not choose Me, but I chose you”* — **John 15:16**), Paul is confronted and sent (**Acts 9:5–6**), and even rulers act within God’s sovereign purpose (**Romans 9:16–18**). Scripture repeatedly denies that salvation originates in human will or effort, insisting instead that it depends on God who shows mercy (*“No one can come to Me unless the Father… draws him”* — **John 6:44**). Semi-Pelagianism ultimately diminishes the depth of sin, weakens the necessity of grace, and shifts assurance from God’s saving action to human decision, whereas the gospel proclaims that salvation from beginning to end is the work of God alone (*“by grace… not of yourselves”* — **Ephesians 2:8–9**), producing humble gratitude rather than confidence in the flesh (**1 Corinthians 1:26–31**).

### **Total Depravity: Fallen, Not Autonomous**

The doctrine of *total depravity* teaches that every part of human nature is affected by sin as a result of Adam’s fall, not that humans always sin to their fullest possible extent. Scripture makes clear that all humanity is *“in Adam”* and therefore spiritually dead apart from grace (**Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:1–3**), meaning no one possesses the natural ability to seek God or initiate salvation (*“There is none who seeks for God”* — **Romans 3:10–12**). At the same time, the Bible affirms that evil is restrained by God through *common grace* and sovereign intervention. God prevented Abimelech from sinning (*“I kept you from sinning against Me”* — **Genesis 20:6**), governs rulers and hearts (**Proverbs 21:1; Romans 13:1**), and even directs hardened hearts to fulfill His purposes (**Exodus 9:12; Romans 9:17–18**).

In addition, Scripture teaches that the **Holy Spirit actively restrains evil**, both in the world and within believers. Paul speaks of a present restraint holding back lawlessness until God’s appointed time (**2 Thessalonians 2:6–7**), and believers are exhorted to *“walk by the Spirit”* so that they do not carry out the desires of the flesh (**Galatians 5:16**). This inner restraint does not originate from human willpower but from God’s indwelling presence, further demonstrating that human obedience flows from divine action. Human beings therefore act willingly, yet never autonomously, choosing according to their fallen nature while being restrained and governed by God. Total depravity does not deny moral responsibility; it explains why salvation and sanctification must originate in God’s mercy rather than human ability (*“It does not depend on the one who wills… but on God who shows mercy”* — **Romans 9:16**), preserving the biblical truth that grace is both necessary and decisive in redemption.

**Chapter 15 – Peter As “Pontifex Maximus” – The Beginnings of the Papacy**

Attila the Hun, *“The Scourge of God”* came to attack Rome June of 452 and Bishop Leo was sent to ask that Rome might be spared. His success, which had more to do with the fact that Attila had already decided to abandon further invasion and to return home, resulted in the Bishop of Rome assuming a new role as a world leader.

The Roman Catholic Church claimed that Jesus Christ had established the papacy with the Apostle Peter. They also claimed that the Bishop of Rome, as the successor of Peter, has supreme authority over the whole church. This was not officially defined until the 1st Vatican Council in 1870.

Pope, or papa, originally expressed the fatherly care of any and every bishop for his flock. There is abundant evidence of Rome’s prominence among the churches of the western regions of the Roman Empire. There are several reasons for this prominence. Rome was the capital of the empire and the Church of Rome was the largest, and wealthiest church. It also had gained a reputation for orthodoxy and charity. Also, despite persecutions of all kind, the congregation in Rome grew in numbers and significance. By the middle of the 3rd Century its membership was about 30,000. Then, as now, size meant influence.

Rome had gained influence through Church Councils and the overall church structure that gave certain bishops authority over other bishops. Bishops from churches established or served by the Apostles had an informal prestige. Regular General Councils began to control more and more of the local church ministry and day to day affairs.

The move from Rome to Constantinople as the capital city set up a conflict and division that ultimately divided the church into Catholic and Orthodox.

Leo’s argument for Rome’s Primacy was based on three scriptures – **Matthew 16:13-19**; **Luke 22:31-32**; **John 21:15-17** – but this concept faced several difficulties that have never been adequately addressed. Among Catholics, this seems to have never been a problem.

First, the Gospels make it very clear that preeminence among the followers of Christ was never to be according to the pattern of the princes of the world; not like the Gentiles, who exercise authority and lord it over those under their authority. Humble service is to be the standard.

Second, Peter continued to be notoriously unstable throughout the Gospels and even in the book of Acts (see **Gal 2:11-14**).

Third, the theory of papal authority assumes that the grant of authority was not to Peter (and the Apostles?) personally but to his office as Bishop of Rome. However, his identification of authority with a particular office is found nowhere in the Scriptures.

Just three years after Leo had successfully negotiated with the Huns, he stood at the gates of Rome, negotiating with the Vandals. This was not nearly as successful. However, the city was not burned, massacre had been avoided and Christian churches had not been plundered. Leo had for a second time saved the city. Now he assumed the old heathen title: *“Pontifices Maximus”* – he was the High Priest of Religion throughout the empire. Leo, not the emperor had taken responsibility for the city. The Pope had come to power.

**6. Read “Important Events in Early Orthodoxy” (page 151) to refresh your understanding of the Orthodox Church.**

**Chapter 16 – Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth – Eastern Orthodox**

The key to understanding Eastern Orthodoxy (and all the varieties of this branch of the church) is found in its holy images, called icons.

Those images of Jesus, Apostles and others are not seen as works of men but as manifestations of the heavenly ideal. Through the icons, the heavenly beings manifest themselves to the worshiping congregations and unite with them in worship.

The great theme of Orthodoxy is the incarnation of God and the re-creation of man. When a man sins, he does not violate the divinely established legal relationship, he reduces the divine likeness and inflicts a wound in the original image of God. So, salvation consists of the perfection or completion of the full image of God in man.

This process is called *“theosis”* or *“deification,”* becoming gods. They maintain, that they are not saying believers become Father, Son or Spirit. They say, believers are transformed into fit companions for an eternal communion with the Triune God.

With the conversion of the Emperor, he became the servant of God and the State became the bearer of the Christian religion because it directly reflected God’s will for the world in human society, since it was the only community established by God. A divided Christianity, over traditions of doctrine and practice was not acceptable. Therefore, Constantine and the emperors who followed, made every effort to secure agreement about the Christian faith.

The conflict over icons was really a disagreement over which things were sacred or holy enough to deserve worship. Some said the Christian clergy, set apart by ordination, are holy. Church buildings are set apart by dedication and they are holy. The martyrs and heroes of the faith are set apart by their deaths and called *“saints,”* so they too deserve the same reverence as the clergy.

The icons proved problematic over the years as the uncontrolled multiplying of icons and holy men would lead people to confine their Christian devotion to local shrines and figures. Many failed to distinguish between the object or the person and the spiritual reality it stood for and fell into idolatry.

Emperor Leo III (717-741) attacked the use of icons. He was motivated by the thought that the defeats of the last century, along with a great earthquake early in his reign, were intended to ring God’s people to their senses.

John of Damascus (730-760) was considered by the Orthodox Church as the last of the early Church Fathers. His argument in favor of icons was based on the idea that the image is never of the same substance as the original. An icon’s significance was to only serve as a reminder of the original.

The differences of doctrine and practice between the Orthodox Church in the East and the Roman Catholic Church in the west widened year after year. Everything from the wording of the creeds, to the different practices required in celebrating Lent, to the type of bread used to celebrate the Eucharist, served to push the two churches apart.

In 1054, Pope Leo IX sent Cardinal Humbert to the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, with the Pope’s Bull of Excommunication (Bull = an official statement from the Pope) and the Great Schism was complete. Now there were two Churches, the Greek Eastern Church (Orthodox) and the Latin Western Church (Catholic).

**Chapter 17 – Bending the Necks of Victors – Mission to the Barbarians**

The year 476 usually marks the end of the Christian Roman Empire in the West. This was the year that rule by German leaders began, after 150 years of chaos.

Rome’s relationship with the Germans was adversarial at times but for the most part cordial. By the end of the 3rd Century many Barbarians (Germans) had settled within the empire. By the end of the 4th Century most the Roman army and its Generals were German. The task of converting the Barbarians was enormous. Bringing them to nominal adherence was not so difficult because they wanted to be a part of the Roman Empire.

The conversion of the Franks was the first of many mass conversions during the Middle Ages. This practice raised important questions about the paganizing of Christianity. Mass conversion was the method used to *“connect”* the European continent. When kings embrace Christianity, their people followed them. There was little instruction prior to baptism, so they generally brought with them their superstitions and unconverted behavior. Despite the shallow impact of the gospel among the Franks (France), their *“conversion”* provided a path to Great Britain.

The initiative for the conversion of the English came from Rome. In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Benedictine monks under the leadership of Augustine (not THE Augustine, this one eventually became known as Augustine of Canterbury). The mission was so successful that eventually Anglo-Saxon England began sending missionaries back to the Continent.
