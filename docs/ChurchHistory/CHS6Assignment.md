date: 33 - 2000 A.D.
instructor: Russell Richardson
course: Church History
description: Understand the benefits and consequences of the union between Church and State in the Roman Empire.
bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**In the Last Session**

- You learned the value of studying church history.

- You thought about and discussed the benefits and challenges in studying church history.

**Persecuted Minority to State Church**

- The movement that started the 4th century as a persecuted minority; ended the century as the established religion of the empire.
- Thus, the Christian Church was joined to the power of the state and assumed a moral responsibility for the whole society.
- Before we can understand the Church’s willing union with the State, we must look back at the Church’s rejection and persecution by the State.
- The intense persecution by Diocletian and Galerius ended when Constantine gained control of the empire by what he believed was the intervention of the Christian’s God through a dream.
- His victory was proof of the power of Jesus Christ and the superiority of the Christian religion.
- The move from persecuted, to favored, to official was gradual.
- Constantine ruled Christian bishops as though they were civil servants and pushed church leaders to resolve doctrinal controversies and maintain unity.
- Before Constantine’s conversion, the Church consisted of convinced believers who were willing to bear the risk of being identified as Christians, even at the cost of their lives.
- Now, many came who were politically ambitious, religiously disinterested and still half-rooted in paganism.
- This produced shallowness and pagan superstition, along with the secularization and misuse of Christianity for political purposes.
- By 380, the rewards for being a Christian gave way to penalties for non-Christians. Emperor Theodosius made belief in Christianity a matter of imperial command.
- Perhaps we should heed the words the English poet Samuel Butler – 1612-1680:
    - *“By this the fool commands the wise, the noble with the base complies …He that complies against his will, is of his own opinion still.”*
- Better still, we should pay attention to Jesus’ instructions to His disciples in **Mark 10:41-45**.
- Jesus points His disciples to the way that the Gentiles build kingdoms and then tells them, in verse 43 - *“But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;”*

**Church Councils**

- During this era and under the urging of Constantine, and other emperors, the Church met in Council to wrestle with the great doctrines of The Trinity and The Nature of Jesus Christ.
- The great merit of the creeds is that they left the mystery intact.
- Fifteen hundred years after the event we may wish for more understandable terms but we dare not say less than the Church said then.
- It is also important for us to remember **Dt 29:29** - *“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law.”*

---

**The Monastic Ideal**

- The Monastic Ideal was a natural development that echoes a Jewish saying: *“If you seek wisdom, go to the wilderness.”*
- There is a longing, born from our frustration with our own failure and the failure of those who are members of the Church to be truly committed, truly spiritual.
- In that longing for holiness and practical sanctification, we look for a path that will lead us to a *“more spiritual”* life.
- C.S. Lewis said, *“There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God.”*
- Luther, and others, condemned the Monastic Ideal because it encouraged the idea of two roads to God, a higher and a lower.
- This concept has plagued the Church in every generation.
- Why would we try to discourage a sold-out commitment to Jesus Christ?
- Because too often it is not a commitment to Jesus Christ; but a commitment to a false shepherd and a set of rules that are at best misunderstood and at worst distortions of the truth that lead to spiritual pride and alienation from the very people Jesus has sent us to bear witness to.
- It is an unnatural concept of the Christian life. There is only one way to God and that is through faith in Jesus Christ.

**Review**

- There is danger in being persecuted.
- There is danger in being the *“State Church.”*
- There is danger in *“trying to be more spiritual than God.”*
- God, in His sovereignty, used the Emperors to push the Church to deal with doctrinal differences.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will be discussing the seven chapters in The Christian Middle Ages.

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE CHRISTIAN ROMAN EMPIRE**

For the rest of this session, you will spend time discussing what your students have learned and what they have written in their summary of each of the eight chapters in *“The Christian Empire.”* They will not only can share their insights, but they will also gain from the insights of their classmates.

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters. Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group.

You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**

*Church History in Plain Language*  
*by Bruce Shelley*

[Church History in Plain Language Chapter summary assignment](ChurchHistoryPlainLanguage.md)

## Question 1

*Discuss the parallels between the situation that Christians faced in Rome and those that we face in our culture today. See “Care for the Dying” (page 101). What were the advantages and disadvantages of Christianity becoming the State Church?*

**How are we to live in a culture increasingly doing what is right in its own eyes?**

> Chapter 10 reminds us that the Church has lived faithfully in both persecution and cultural favor, and that neither condition guarantees spiritual health. Like believers during the reigns of Diocletian and Galerius, Christians today may feel pressure to conform or to retreat when culture turns hostile. Yet history shows that fear-driven compromise does not nullify genuine faith, just as Peter’s threefold denial did not disqualify him from restoration and service **(Luke 22:31–32; John 21:15–17)**. We are therefore called to live contrary to our culture not out of rebellion or self-righteousness, but out of love for Christ and a desire to please Him (2 Corinthians 5:9). Our response to injustice, moral confusion, and open hostility toward God is not retaliation, but faithful obedience, humility, and prayer—kneeling before the Lord and entrusting our fears to Him (**Philippians 4:6–7**). Chapter 10 warns that cultural approval can be as dangerous as persecution, reminding us that the Church’s strength is not found in power or protection, but in steadfast devotion to Christ, compassionate witness, and trust in God’s sovereignty even when society openly does what is right in its own eyes.

## Question 2

*Read and discuss this statement: Rejected Trinitarian Schemes (Pages 106-107) and Why is the Trinity Important? (Pages 111-112) (See also chart 28 and page 123 in textbook)*

> Attempts to explain the Trinity through natural analogies—such as an egg, water, or a plant—ultimately fail because they remove the personal nature of God and tend to slide into old heresies. These illustrations may help conceptually, but they distort the biblical teaching by reducing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to parts, modes, or impersonal forms. Chapter 11 shows that the Trinity is not a human invention but a doctrine drawn from Scripture, preserving both God’s oneness and the full personhood of each member of the Godhead. The Trinity is essential because it protects the gospel itself: the Father sends, the Son redeems, and the Spirit applies salvation. As **Deuteronomy 29:29** reminds us, there is a point where faithful theology submits to revelation, accepting mystery rather than reshaping God into something more understandable.
>
> As **Deuteronomy 29:29** teaches, God has revealed what we need to know about Himself, and those revealed truths belong to us. Scripture affirms that God is not partially known, since *“in Christ all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily”* (**Colossians 2:9**). The Trinity, therefore, is not a retreat into mystery but a faithful confession of what God has revealed—fully true, though not exhaustively comprehended.
>
> At the same time, Scripture also affirms that God has fully revealed Himself in Christ. Paul states clearly that *“in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily”* (**Colossians 2:9**), and that Christ is *“the image of the invisible God”* (**Colossians 1:15**). This means God is not partially revealed or obscured—He is truly and savingly known in Jesus.
>
> The tension, then, is not between revelation and mystery, but between revelation and exhaustion. God is fully revealed, but not exhaustively comprehended. We truly know God as He has made Himself known, yet we do not master or reduce Him to human categories. This is why the Church insisted on precise language in Trinitarian doctrine: not to explain God away, but to protect what has been revealed from distortion.
>
> So a stronger way to say it might be:
>
> God has revealed Himself fully and truly in Christ, but He has not revealed Himself exhaustively. What He has made known belongs to us—and it is enough.
>
> That keeps you grounded in biblical revelation, not philosophical mystery, and it aligns cleanly with the creeds without surrendering clarity.
>

## Question 3

*Is it “Either/Or” or “Both/And”?*

> The history of the creeds shows that the Church never viewed worship and doctrine as an either/or choice, but as a necessary both/and. True worship flows from a right understanding of who Christ is, and sound doctrine naturally leads believers to praise, not pride. As J. S. Whale observed, the Church’s safest language about Christ is often found in worship, yet this worship must be anchored in truth or it easily drifts into sentimentality or error. The Christological heresies forced the Church to clarify doctrine not to suppress worship, but to protect it—because a Christ who is less than fully God cannot save, and a Christ who is less than fully human cannot redeem humanity (**John 1:14; Colossians 2:9**). The creeds preserved this balance by setting boundaries rather than explaining away the mystery, allowing believers to sing, confess, and adore the true Christ while remaining faithful to apostolic teaching (**1 Corinthians 11:19; Deuteronomy 29:29**). Therefore, Christian faith is strongest when worship and doctrine remain united, as loving God with heart and mind together guards the Church from error and deepens devotion to Christ.

## Question 4

*Discuss the major heresies about Christ – page 123 in textbook & Chart 26.*

The major heresies about Christ in the early church all revolved around who Jesus is—specifically His divinity, humanity, and the relationship between the two. Some denied His full deity, others His full humanity, and still others confused or divided His natures. *Arianism* taught that Christ was a created being, not fully God, directly contradicting Scripture that presents Him as eternal and divine (e.g., **John 1:1, Colossians 1:15–17**). *Docetism* denied Christ’s true humanity, claiming He only appeared to be human, undermining the reality of the incarnation and the atonement (**1 John 4:2–3**). *Apollinarianism* affirmed Christ’s deity but denied a full human nature by claiming He lacked a human mind, which compromised His ability to fully represent humanity. *Nestorianism* divided Christ into two persons—one divine and one human—rather than one person with two natures, while *Eutychianism (Monophysitism)* blended His natures into one, confusing deity and humanity. In response, the church carefully articulated orthodox Christology through councils, especially Chalcedon (AD 451), confessing that Jesus Christ is one person in two natures, fully God and fully man, without confusion, change, division, or separation. These heresies mattered because any distortion of Christ’s person ultimately distorts the gospel itself—only a Savior who is truly God and truly man can accomplish true redemption.

## Question 5

5. *What are some ways that the church today may be exiles from life? What are our motivations? What do we hope to gain? What are the pitfalls?*

> In many ways, the church today has become increasingly *exiled from life*, especially since COVID, by retreating into safe and controlled spaces rather than engaging the world with the gospel. Church life is often confined to a building and limited to scheduled gatherings, with worship and the interpretation of Scripture centered almost exclusively on Sundays. While corporate worship and teaching are essential, the Church was commissioned to *“go into all the world and preach the gospel”* (**Matthew 28:19–20**), not to remain contained within its own walls. When the Church becomes inward-focused, it risks functioning more as a refuge from the world than as a witness to it.
>
>The motivation behind this exile is often rooted in fear and deception. There is a desire to feel safe, protected, and affirmed, and the enemy exploits this by encouraging exclusivity that quietly sidelines the Great Commission. While community, love, peace, and the practice of the biblical *“one anothers”* are genuine goods the Church hopes to gain, they can become substitutes for mission rather than fuel for it. As **Colossians 2:18–23** warns, practices that appear spiritual can lose their power when they are detached from Christ’s purpose, becoming inward, self-protective, and ultimately ineffective.
>
>The primary pitfall is that disciple-making is replaced with information-sharing. We trade the joy of making disciples for the comfort of *rightly dividing the word* in isolation, forgetting that Scripture was given to be lived out and proclaimed. A proper balance is needed: the gospel must be presented accurately to avoid cheap grace and easy believism, yet it must also be carried outward in obedience to Christ. We are not called merely to make converts, but disciples—people whom God is already drawing to Himself—training them both in faithful living and in correctly handling the Word of truth. True maturity is found not in exile from life, but in faithful engagement with it for the glory of God.

## Modern Semi-Pelagianism

Modern *semi-Pelagianism* is widespread in the contemporary church, often affirming the language of human fallenness while quietly preserving human autonomy at the decisive moment of salvation. While Scripture teaches that all humanity is truly *“in Adam”* and spiritually dead apart from grace (**Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:1–3**), semi-Pelagianism reframes this condition as moral weakness rather than total inability, allowing faith to function as an unfallen human capacity. God’s grace is said to enable salvation, yet the final determination is placed in the human will, with election reduced to divine foreknowledge of human choice. This stands in contrast to the consistent biblical pattern in which God initiates, calls, and appoints—Abraham is called (**Genesis 12:1**), Mary is chosen (**Luke 1:30**), the disciples are commanded (*“You did not choose Me, but I chose you”* — **John 15:16**), Paul is confronted and sent (**Acts 9:5–6**), and even rulers act within God’s sovereign purpose (**Romans 9:16–18**). Scripture repeatedly denies that salvation originates in human will or effort, insisting instead that it depends on God who shows mercy (*“No one can come to Me unless the Father… draws him”* — **John 6:44**). Semi-Pelagianism ultimately diminishes the depth of sin, weakens the necessity of grace, and shifts assurance from God’s saving action to human decision, whereas the gospel proclaims that salvation from beginning to end is the work of God alone (*“by grace… not of yourselves”* — **Ephesians 2:8–9**), producing humble gratitude rather than confidence in the flesh (**1 Corinthians 1:26–31**).

### **Total Depravity: Fallen, Not Autonomous — Yet Fully Accountable**

The doctrine of *total depravity* teaches that every aspect of human nature is affected by sin as a result of Adam’s fall, meaning humanity is spiritually dead and incapable of seeking God apart from grace (**Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:1–3**). This condition does not imply autonomy; Scripture consistently denies that human beings act independently of God. Rather, all human choices flow from a fallen nature and occur within God’s sovereign restraint and governance (*“In Him we live and move and have our being”* — **Acts 17:28**). God restrains evil through common grace—preventing Abimelech from sinning (**Genesis 20:6**), directing the hearts of rulers (**Proverbs 21:1; Romans 13:1**), and even ordering hardened hearts to fulfill His purposes (**Exodus 9:12; Romans 9:17–18**). The Holy Spirit also restrains lawlessness in the world (**2 Thessalonians 2:6–7**) and indwells believers to oppose the desires of the flesh (**Galatians 5:16**), making it clear that no human action is truly autonomous.

At the same time, Scripture affirms the full **moral responsibility of the unbeliever**. Though fallen and unable to please God, unbelievers are not excused from accountability, because God has clearly revealed Himself through creation and conscience. *“What can be known about God is plain to them… so they are without excuse”* (**Romans 1:19–20**). Humanity’s suppression of truth is not caused by ignorance but by willful rebellion, as people *“did not see fit to acknowledge God”* (**Romans 1:28**). Thus, while no one comes to God apart from divine grace, all are justly accountable for their sin and unbelief. Total depravity denies autonomy but does not deny responsibility; it magnifies God’s justice in judgment and His mercy in salvation, affirming that condemnation is deserved and redemption is wholly of grace (**Romans 3:19; Romans 9:16**).

**Chapter 15 – Peter As “Pontifex Maximus” – The Beginnings of the Papacy**

## Pergamum 3rd Church period in Revelation 2 (313-600AD)

**AD 313 – The Edict of Milan**

- Issued by **Constantine**
- Legalized Christianity after nearly three centuries of persecution
- Returned confiscated church property
- Marked the **end of the persecuted church** and the beginning of the **imperial church**

This moment aligns closely with **Pergamum** in **Revelation 2:12–17**, where Christ says:

> *“I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is… and you hold fast My name.”*

Pergamum represents a church that **dwells where power is**, no longer hunted, but **entangled with the state**. Christianity moves from the catacombs to the palace. The danger is no longer martyrdom, but **compromise**.

By **AD 600**, several developments closed the Pergamum era and transitioned toward Thyatira:

- The **Western Roman Empire** had fully collapsed (**476**)
- The **Justinianic Plague (AD 541–549)** had devastated population and stability
- The papacy, especially under **Gregory the Great (590–604)**, had assumed civil authority
- The Church was no longer merely aligned with empire — it was **replacing it**

This marks a shift from *church alongside empire* (Pergamum) to *church ruling society* (Thyatira).

### **The Two Stages of the Black Plague**

1. **Justinianic Plague** — **AD 541–549**

   - Occurred during the Pergamum period
   - Weakened both empire and society
   - Accelerated the Church’s rise as caretaker and authority

2. **Later Black Death** — **AD 1347–1351**

   - Occurred much later, during the Thyatira period (High Middle Ages)

> The period from **AD 313 to 600** corresponds closely with the **Pergamum church age** described in **Revelation 2**, often called the *Roman Empire Church*. This era began with the **Edict of Milan (313)**, when Christianity was legalized and brought into partnership with imperial power under Constantine. While persecution ceased, the Church now dwelt *“where Satan’s throne is,”* facing the new danger of compromise rather than oppression. As the empire weakened through barbarian invasions and the **Justinianic Plague (541–549)**, the Church increasingly assumed civic and moral responsibility. By the time of **Gregory the Great (590–604)**, the bishop of Rome had become a stabilizing force amid collapse, signaling the close of the Pergamum era. By **600 AD**, the Church had moved beyond coexistence with empire into a position of social authority, paving the way for the next church age.

**Revelation 2:12-17**

> *Message to Pergamum*  
> 12 *“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write:*  
> *The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this:*  
> 13 *‘I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. 14But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality. 15So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 16Therefore repent; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth. 17He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.’*
