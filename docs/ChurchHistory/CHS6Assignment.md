bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**Begin video.**

**In the Last Session**

- You learned the value of studying church history.
- You are now able to explain the extraordinary spread of the gospel in the age of catholic Christianity.
- You thought about and discussed the benefits and challenges in studying church history.

**Persecuted Minority to State Church**

- The movement that started the 4th century as a persecuted minority; ended the century as the established religion of the empire.
- Thus, the Christian Church was joined to the power of the state and assumed a moral responsibility for the whole society.
- Before we can understand the Church’s willing union with the State, we must look back at the Church’s rejection and persecution by the State.
- The intense persecution by Diocletian and Galerius ended when Constantine gained control of the empire by what he believed was the intervention of the Christian’s God through a dream.
- His victory was proof of the power of Jesus Christ and the superiority of the Christian religion.
- The move from persecuted, to favored, to official was gradual.
- Constantine ruled Christian bishops as though they were civil servants and pushed church leaders to resolve doctrinal controversies and maintain unity.
- Before Constantine’s conversion, the Church consisted of convinced believers who were willing to bear the risk of being identified as Christians, even at the cost of their lives.
- Now, many came who were politically ambitious, religiously disinterested and still half-rooted in paganism.
- This produced shallowness and pagan superstition, along with the secularization and misuse of Christianity for political purposes.
- By 380, the rewards for being a Christian gave way to penalties for non-Christians. Emperor Theodosius made belief in Christianity a matter of imperial command.
- Perhaps we should heed the words the English poet Samuel Butler – 1612-1680:
    - *“By this the fool commands the wise, the noble with the base complies …He that complies against his will, is of his own opinion still.”*
- Better still, we should pay attention to Jesus’ instructions to His disciples in **Mark 10:41-45**.
- Jesus points His disciples to the way that the Gentiles build kingdoms and then tells them, in verse 43 - *“But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;”*

**Church Councils**

- During this era and under the urging of Constantine, and other emperors, the Church met in Council to wrestle with the great doctrines of The Trinity and The Nature of Jesus Christ.
- The great merit of the creeds is that they left the mystery intact.
- Fifteen hundred years after the event we may wish for more understandable terms but we dare not say less than the Church said then.
- It is also important for us to remember **Dt 29:29** - *“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law.”*

---

**The Monastic Ideal**

- The Monastic Ideal was a natural development that echoes a Jewish saying: *“If you seek wisdom, go to the wilderness.”*
- There is a longing, born from our frustration with our own failure and the failure of those who are members of the Church to be truly committed, truly spiritual.
- In that longing for holiness and practical sanctification, we look for a path that will lead us to a *“more spiritual”* life.
- C.S. Lewis said, *“There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God.”*
- Luther, and others, condemned the Monastic Ideal because it encouraged the idea of two roads to God, a higher and a lower.
- This concept has plagued the Church in every generation.
- Why would we try to discourage a sold-out commitment to Jesus Christ?
- Because too often it is not a commitment to Jesus Christ; but a commitment to a false shepherd and a set of rules that are at best misunderstood and at worst distortions of the truth that lead to spiritual pride and alienation from the very people Jesus has sent us to bear witness to.
- It is an unnatural concept of the Christian life. There is only one way to God and that is through faith in Jesus Christ.

**Review**

- There is danger in being persecuted.
- There is danger in being the *“State Church.”*
- There is danger in *“trying to be more spiritual than God.”*
- God, in His sovereignty, used the Emperors to push the Church to deal with doctrinal differences.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will be discussing the seven chapters in The Christian Middle Ages.

## Key Verses

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE CHRISTIAN ROMAN EMPIRE**

For the rest of this session, you will spend time discussing what your students have learned and what they have written in their summary of each of the eight chapters in *“The Christian Empire.”* They will not only can share their insights, but they will also gain from the insights of their classmates.

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters. Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group.

You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**

*Church History in Plain Language*  
*by Bruce Shelley*

**The Age of the Christian Roman Empire – 312-590 AD**

The movement started the fourth century as a persecuted minority; it ended the century as the established religion of the empire. Thus, the Christian Church was joined to the power of the state and assumed a moral responsibility for the whole society.

**Chapter 9 – Laying Her Scepter Down – The Conversion of the Empire**

With the Christianization of the empire, the imperial interference in the affairs of the church begins. Even today we can detect the fallout of these two developments.

**Turning Around an Empire**

The Roman Empire was crumbling. Thirty emperors had claimed the throne in the 3rd Century and many others had tried. Most thoughtful Romans were in despair.

**Christians To the Flames (see chart 20)**

As emperor, Diocletian (284-305) inherited anarchy, instability and chaos. At the end of his 20-year reign he passed on a revived empire to his successors. For some unknown reason, after 18 years of ignoring Christians, he suddenly ordered the most vicious of all persecutions against them – even though his wife and daughter were considered Christian.

He purged his court and army of Christians, ordered church buildings destroyed, prohibited Christian worship and had the Christian Scriptures burned. Bishops were rounded up, imprisoned and many were executed.

In 305, according to his plan, Diocletian abdicated the throne. His replacement, Galerius pushed ahead with the goal of exterminating Christianity. Many Christians believed that Galerius had been the instigator of the purge from the beginning.

Thousands of terrified Christians had recanted but thousands of others stood fast. The Bishop of Carthage demanded that those who needlessly rushed into martyrdom should not be considered martyrs.

Eventually, public opinion throughout the empire turned against the torture, maiming and killing. As one of his last official acts, Galerius reluctantly issued an edict of toleration, and for all practical purposes, the last and worst persecution of Christians by the Roman State came to an end.

Constantine (312-337) became the emperor after defeating his rival, in what he considered the power of Christ. From that day on he favored Christianity and brought about many positive reforms. The advantage for the Church was real, but there was a price to pay. Prior to Constantine’s conversion, the Church had consisted of converted believers, willing to risk being identified as Christians. Now, many came who were politically ambitious, religiously disinterested and still half-rooted in paganism.

By 380, rewards for Christians had given way to penalties for non-Christians. Emperor Theodosius made belief in Christianity a matter of imperial command.

**1. Discuss the parallels between the situation that Christians faced in Rome and those that we face in our culture today. See “Care for the Dying” (page 101). What were the advantages and disadvantages of Christianity becoming the State Church?**

There are few of us who face physical persecution in the West but we are certainly out of sync with our culture and face a certain hostility and rejection. The Roman culture was certainly as depraved, if not more so than our own. – Perhaps we should consider how we can care for those that our culture rejects and abandons – Care for the Dying. – The main advantage for the church was no more martyrdom! Being favored brought more people to at least hear the Gospel. Becoming the State Church though, sowed tares in abundance and with the Emperor as the head of the Church, it seems as if resistance was futile.

**Chapter 10 – Splitting Important Hairs – The Doctrine of the Trinity**

Constantine was troubled by reports from all quarters, of the bitterness Christians were displaying over theological issues. A divided, quarreling Christianity could not hold the crumbling empire together. (Consider **1 Corinthians 11:19**)

**Making Sense of the Mystery**

Progress toward appreciating the doctrine of the Trinity can be made by understanding what it is not. The early Church typically believed the Trinity to be a mystery that was to be honored or respected and not simply a riddle to be solved or explained by some logical exercise.

However, everyone was not on board. Arius openly challenged the teachers in Alexandria, asserting that the Logos was a lesser god and had a different nature than God (The Father). This teaching appealed to many *“pagan Christians,”* since it was like the religion of their youth. Bishop Alexander called for a synod (320), assembled churchmen and together they condemned Arius’ teachings and excommunicated him.

Constantine called for the Council of Nicea in 325, opening the council with the declaration, *“division in the Church is worse than war.”* Having made his point, he committed the resolution of the conflict into the hands of the church leaders.

Arius’ teachings were loudly rejected. All but two Bishops signed on to the Nicene Creed. They, along with Arius, were sent into exile.

After Nicea, Constantine and his successors stepped in again and again to banish churchmen, depending on which group of advisors had the upper hand in the palace or

2. Read and discuss this statement: Rejected Trinitarian Schemes (Pages 106-107) and Why is the Trinity Important? (Pages 111-112) (See also chart 28 and page 123 in textbook)

- Christians have often appealed to the natural realm to try to illustrate the concept and reality of the Trinity. The yolk, white and shell of an egg, the root, tree and fruit of a plant or even water in its three forms: ice, liquid and vapor. However, they all completely miss the personal element in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. At some point in our process of trying to understand or explain the doctrine of the Trinity, we should accept the scriptural teaching and submit our understanding or comprehension to **Deut. 29:29** – *The secret things belong to God; the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever.*

Chapter 11 – Emmanuel! – Christ in The Creeds

- The Word Became Flesh is central to Christian worship

- J.S. Whale: *“A deep instinct has always told the Church that our safest eloquence concerning the mystery of Christ is in our praise. A living Church is a worshiping, singing Church; not a school of people holding all the correct doctrines.”*

3. Is it “Either/Or?” Or “Both/And?”

- Why does it have to be one or the other? Why can’t we sing and worship AND hold to true doctrine at the same time?

4. Discuss the major heresies about Christ – page 123 in textbook & Chart 26.

Major heresies about Christ forced the churches to clarify: *“Who is Jesus Christ?”* (**1 Corinthians 11:19**) They also forced the churches to establish the boundaries of truth!

- Apollinarian = Only the body represented Christ’s human nature  
  - rejected @ 2nd Council @ Constantinople – 381

- Nestorius = the merging of wills vs. an essential union – mostly misunderstood = rejected at Council of Ephesus 431

- Eutyches = “monophisitism” defended the one nature of Christ, combining the two so intimately that the human nature was absorbed completely, lost and dissolved by the divine nature.  
  - rejected @ 4th Council @ Chalcedon – 451

In the Chalcedonian statement, the churches declared: In Jesus Christ, true deity (against Arius) and full humanity (against Apollinaris) are indivisibly united in One Person (against Nestorius) without being confused (against Eutyches).

To state it another way: So, against Arius the church affirmed that Jesus was truly God, and against Apollinaris, that He was truly man. Against Eutyches it confessed that Jesus’ deity and humanity were not changed into something else, and against Nestorius, that Jesus was not divided but one person.

The merit of the Chalcedonian statement lies in the boundaries it established. In effect, it erected a fence and said: *“Within this lies the mystery of the God-man.”*

Fifteen hundred years after the event we may wish for more understandable terms, but we dare not say less than the church said then.

Chapter 12 – Exiles from Life – The Beginnings of Monasticism

There is a Jewish saying: *“If you seek wisdom, go into the wilderness.”* This advice was most certainly meant as a temporary retreat, rather than a lifestyle.

Monasticism (monks and nuns) is a religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual work. Monastic life plays an important role in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, as well as in many non-Christian religions. The word comes from the Greek word for *“alone”* and describes those who live alone, completely isolated from others and the world. It also describes those who would live alone together, with a wide variety of rules and regulations. They were generally seeking spiritual perfection and perceived physical comforts, as well as other people, to be hindrances to that spiritual perfection.

Catholics and Protestants generally disagree over the *“Monastic Ideal.”* Catholics say that the church has to make room for the ascetics, who strive for spiritual perfection through self-denial, isolation, prayer and self-abasement; as well as make room for weak, sinful members who show few signs of grace.

It is true that we are all in process of becoming more like Christ (**Romans 8:28-29**). However, Martin Luther, who himself had lived as a cloistered (isolated) monk, realized that Monasticism encourages the idea of two roads to God, a higher and a lower.

One form of the Monastic Ideal was the lonely hermit, who fled to the desert or wilderness to protest the corruption of the Church and the corruption of the world.

Yet, somehow, temptations followed them into the desert and behind the walls. They were led into the dangers of pronounced individualism and the temptations of pride, rivalry and eccentricity.

The Monastic Ideal eventually moved from hermits to communal life with fixed hours of manual labor, uniform garb and strict discipline. This addressed the hermits dangers of idleness and eccentricity. It also brought some restraint to the excesses of the Monastic Ideal and provided a realistic opportunity for women to pursue this ideal.

Pachomius instituted the 1st Christian monastery about 320 AD. He had the right idea: *“To save souls you must bring them together.”* The process of sanctification happens best in community. This was another example of an attempt to reform the Church, which was not providing the community that would move us along in our becoming more like Christ.

In the 3rd and 4th Centuries the Monastic Ideal swelled into a movement that affected all levels of the Christian population. Many found the *ascetic way* (*the practice of severe self-discipline and abstaining from all forms of indulgence*) to be an acceptable substitute for the spiritual heroism of the days of persecution.

Monks and nuns transformed the spirit of martyrdom into the full commitment to God and the imitation of the sufferings of Christ. They pursued this full commitment to God with vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the rules of the monastery and the monastery leaders.

In the 5th and 6th Centuries, practically every leader in the church was either a monk or closely linked to monasticism. The monastic cell became a study and the monks became scholars.

Benedict of Nursia (Italy – 480-543) was no scholar but he had a genius for administration and a profound knowledge of people. He made discipline a fundamental, yet he saw that it must not be too heavy a yoke. Benedictine Rules showed a remarkable restraint with some degree of freedom. A Benedictine monastery was a little world in itself. They had a strenuous life of worship, vigorous labor and serious reading.

**The Monastic Ideal**

- The monasteries helped provide stability during the collapse of the old Roman civilization.
- They provided an opportunity for the Scriptures to be copied and studied.
- They eventually sent out a large number of missionaries into often hostile countries.

However, the vow of poverty did not extend to the monastery itself. Eventually the original rigor of the monasteries declined and there were constant efforts to reform the local church substitute. Above all, the Monastic Ideal and the monastery system had an unnatural conception of the Christian life and an erroneous, unbiblical view of humanity.

**5. What are some ways that the church today may be exiles from life? What are our motivations? What do we hope to gain? What are the pitfalls?**

- Consider **Col 2:18-23** in connection with the Monastic Ideal. Perhaps, many of us can identify with being frustrated with the church, or those in the church who do not seem to be as committed to the Lord as we think they should be. I, for one, experienced a severe case of spiritual pride in my high school days. I saw myself as superior to most of my fellow youth group members and many adults in our church as well. Thankfully the Lord exposed my hypocrisy and many of my fellow church members were very gracious and forgiving.

**Chapter 13 – The Sage of The Ages – Augustine**

Aurelius Augustinus (Augustine) from Algeria born 11/13/354 – 430. His father was an easy-going heathen and his mother was an eager Christian. They determined to provide him with the best education available. This ultimately took him to Carthage, the North African capital. (Today it is in Tunisia).

Augustine struggled, but consistently lost, with sexual temptation. He considered this to be his defiling passion. It marked his conception of sin and the depravity from which he later felt himself rescued by God’s grace.

Augustine, in his search for deliverance, tried Manicheanism for several years. The fundamental belief of the religion pictured an eternal conflict between two powers: good and evil, with the spiritual part of humanity being the good and the physical part being evil. Victory can be attained by prayer and abstinence from all enjoyments of evil: riches, lust, wine, luxurious houses, among other physically pleasing things. Like Gnosticism, it taught that Jesus had no material body and did not actually die. They held that much of the New Testament was true, but rejected all of it that suggested that Christ’s sufferings were real. They also rejected all the Old Testament.

When Augustine was 30, he began teaching at the University of Milan where he was moved by the powerful preaching of Bishop Ambrose and the personal example of the monks. His sense of sin and powerlessness were stirred. One day, as he walked through his garden, he heard a child sing: *“Take up and read.”* He picked up a New Testament and read **Romans 13:13-14** – *“…put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.”* Instantly he experienced the light of peace poured into his heart and all shadows of doubt faded away.

He was baptized in 387 by Ambrose in Milan and then returned to Africa. In three years later at Hippo, he was ordained a priest, against his will, and was assigned to be the assistant Bishop. Then one year later he became the Bishop at the age of 43.

North Africa was during a conflict between the Catholic Church and the 100-year-old Donatist Movement. Donatus (313-355) had been the Bishop of Carthage. The movement stood for a holy church, church discipline and resistance of unworthy bishops. He felt those who had surrendered the Scriptures to be burned during the Diocletian persecution (303-311) were guilty of apostasy and should be disqualified as bishops, as well as those who ordained them. He believed that the validity of the sacrament depends upon the moral standing of the minister.

Augustine rejected the Donatist’s views of a pure church. He believed that the church would be a mixed-multitude until the day of judgment. He supported this view with Jesus’ parable of the Wheat and The Tares – **Matthew 13:24-30**. He also viewed the sacraments as belonging to Christ, not the priests. All that is required of the priest is an awareness that he administers God’s grace for the whole church. This controversy led Augustine to support the use of force in the suppression of rivals and was used later to justify the Inquisition.

Augustine also stood against the British monk Pelagius and his teachings. Pelagian teaching denied the doctrine of inherited sin from Adam. They taught instead, that humans are free to act righteously or sinfully. He also taught that death is not a consequence of Adam’s sin. Adam’s introduction of sin into the world was just a corrupting example. He also taught that God predestinates no one – He foresees their choices. He also taught that forgiveness is by faith alone; once forgiven man has the power of himself to live pleasing to God.

**The City of God on the Ruins of Rome**

Augustine wrote: The City of God – dealing with the relationship between earthly cities that are temporary and the Heavenly City which is everlasting. This influenced, directly or indirectly, the thought of Christians on what they owed to God and what to Caesar over the next 15 centuries.

**Chapter 14 – Peter As “Pontifex Maximus” – The Beginnings of the Papacy**

Attila the Hun, *“The Scourge of God”* came to attack Rome June of 452 and Bishop Leo was sent to ask that Rome might be spared. His success, which had more to do with the fact that Attila had already decided to abandon further invasion and to return home, resulted in the Bishop of Rome assuming a new role as a world leader.

The Roman Catholic Church claimed that Jesus Christ had established the papacy with the Apostle Peter. They also claimed that the Bishop of Rome, as the successor of Peter, has supreme authority over the whole church. This was not officially defined until the 1st Vatican Council in 1870.

Pope, or papa, originally expressed the fatherly care of any and every bishop for his flock. There is abundant evidence of Rome’s prominence among the churches of the western regions of the Roman Empire. There are several reasons for this prominence. Rome was the capital of the empire and the Church of Rome was the largest, and wealthiest church. It also had gained a reputation for orthodoxy and charity. Also, despite persecutions of all kind, the congregation in Rome grew in numbers and significance. By the middle of the 3rd Century its membership was about 30,000. Then, as now, size meant influence.

Rome had gained influence through Church Councils and the overall church structure that gave certain bishops authority over other bishops. Bishops from churches established or served by the Apostles had an informal prestige. Regular General Councils began to control more and more of the local church ministry and day to day affairs.

The move from Rome to Constantinople as the capital city set up a conflict and division that ultimately divided the church into Catholic and Orthodox.

Leo’s argument for Rome’s Primacy was based on three scriptures – **Matthew 16:13-19**; **Luke 22:31-32**; **John 21:15-17** – but this concept faced several difficulties that have never been adequately addressed. Among Catholics, this seems to have never been a problem.

First, the Gospels make it very clear that preeminence among the followers of Christ was never to be according to the pattern of the princes of the world; not like the Gentiles, who exercise authority and lord it over those under their authority. Humble service is to be the standard.

Second, Peter continued to be notoriously unstable throughout the Gospels and even in the book of Acts (see **Gal 2:11-14**).

Third, the theory of papal authority assumes that the grant of authority was not to Peter (and the Apostles?) personally but to his office as Bishop of Rome. However, his identification of authority with a particular office is found nowhere in the Scriptures.

Just three years after Leo had successfully negotiated with the Huns, he stood at the gates of Rome, negotiating with the Vandals. This was not nearly as successful. However, the city was not burned, massacre had been avoided and Christian churches had not been plundered. Leo had for a second time saved the city. Now he assumed the old heathen title: *“Pontifices Maximus”* – he was the High Priest of Religion throughout the empire. Leo, not the emperor had taken responsibility for the city. The Pope had come to power.

**6. Read “Important Events in Early Orthodoxy” (page 151) to refresh your understanding of the Orthodox Church.**

**Chapter 15 – Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth – Eastern Orthodox**

The key to understanding Eastern Orthodoxy (and all the varieties of this branch of the church) is found in its holy images, called icons.

Those images of Jesus, Apostles and others are not seen as works of men but as manifestations of the heavenly ideal. Through the icons, the heavenly beings manifest themselves to the worshiping congregations and unite with them in worship.

The great theme of Orthodoxy is the incarnation of God and the re-creation of man. When a man sins, he does not violate the divinely established legal relationship, he reduces the divine likeness and inflicts a wound in the original image of God. So, salvation consists of the perfection or completion of the full image of God in man.

This process is called *“theosis”* or *“deification,”* becoming gods. They maintain, that they are not saying believers become Father, Son or Spirit. They say, believers are transformed into fit companions for an eternal communion with the Triune God.

With the conversion of the Emperor, he became the servant of God and the State became the bearer of the Christian religion because it directly reflected God’s will for the world in human society, since it was the only community established by God. A divided Christianity, over traditions of doctrine and practice was not acceptable. Therefore, Constantine and the emperors who followed, made every effort to secure agreement about the Christian faith.

The conflict over icons was really a disagreement over which things were sacred or holy enough to deserve worship. Some said the Christian clergy, set apart by ordination, are holy. Church buildings are set apart by dedication and they are holy. The martyrs and heroes of the faith are set apart by their deaths and called *“saints,”* so they too deserve the same reverence as the clergy.

The icons proved problematic over the years as the uncontrolled multiplying of icons and holy men would lead people to confine their Christian devotion to local shrines and figures. Many failed to distinguish between the object or the person and the spiritual reality it stood for and fell into idolatry.

Emperor Leo III (717-741) attacked the use of icons. He was motivated by the thought that the defeats of the last century, along with a great earthquake early in his reign, were intended to ring God’s people to their senses.

John of Damascus (730-760) was considered by the Orthodox Church as the last of the early Church Fathers. His argument in favor of icons was based on the idea that the image is never of the same substance as the original. An icon’s significance was to only serve as a reminder of the original.

The differences of doctrine and practice between the Orthodox Church in the East and the Roman Catholic Church in the west widened year after year. Everything from the wording of the creeds, to the different practices required in celebrating Lent, to the type of bread used to celebrate the Eucharist, served to push the two churches apart.

In 1054, Pope Leo IX sent Cardinal Humbert to the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, with the Pope’s Bull of Excommunication (Bull = an official statement from the Pope) and the Great Schism was complete. Now there were two Churches, the Greek Eastern Church (Orthodox) and the Latin Western Church (Catholic).

**Chapter 16 – Bending the Necks of Victors – Mission to the Barbarians**

The year 476 usually marks the end of the Christian Roman Empire in the West. This was the year that rule by German leaders began, after 150 years of chaos.

Rome’s relationship with the Germans was adversarial at times but for the most part cordial. By the end of the 3rd Century many Barbarians (Germans) had settled within the empire. By the end of the 4th Century most the Roman army and its Generals were German. The task of converting the Barbarians was enormous. Bringing them to nominal adherence was not so difficult because they wanted to be a part of the Roman Empire.

The conversion of the Franks was the first of many mass conversions during the Middle Ages. This practice raised important questions about the paganizing of Christianity. Mass conversion was the method used to *“connect”* the European continent. When kings embrace Christianity, their people followed them. There was little instruction prior to baptism, so they generally brought with them their superstitions and unconverted behavior. Despite the shallow impact of the gospel among the Franks (France), their *“conversion”* provided a path to Great Britain.

The initiative for the conversion of the English came from Rome. In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Benedictine monks under the leadership of Augustine (not THE Augustine, this one eventually became known as Augustine of Canterbury). The mission was so successful that eventually Anglo-Saxon England began sending missionaries back to the Continent.
