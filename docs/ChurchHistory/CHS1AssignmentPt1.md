title: Church History Session 1 Part 1 - Introduction/Doctrine of Inspiration
date: 33 - 2000 A.D.
instructor: Russell Richardson
course: Church History
description: Know the importance of the study of Church History. Identify three lessons that will help keep you from repeating the mistakes of the past. (Keep Balanced; Not this way among you = not the way of the Gentiles. Mark 10:43; Contend for the faith = not our culture or traditions.)
bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**Begin video.**

**Introduction**

- Course title; *“Church History, Ecclesiology and the History of Christian Doctrine.”*
- Goal in this course is NOT to memorize dates, names and events.
- You will gain knowledge, perspective and resources to help you understand what the Bible teaches about the Church, as well as, the how and why the Christian Church and Christian doctrine developed through the years.

**Ecclesiology: The Study of the Church**

- You will look at what the Church is, what the Church is like, where the Church met, how the Church is to function and what the Church is to do.

**Church History and History of Christian Doctrine**
You will:

- See the struggles and the sacrifices made by those who contended for the faith and did the hard work involved in developing the doctrines into today’s form.
- Gain a great appreciation for their work and for God’s sovereignty in preserving the truth for us.

---

**Upon Course Completion**
You will have:

- A solid foundation for further study of these subjects.
- An understanding of God’s purpose for the Church.
- An understanding of how the Church should function.

You will develop:

- Develop a deep and lasting love for *“the Church of God, which He purchased with His own blood.”* **Acts 20:28**

You will understand:

- The Church has always needed reform and that amid our humanity and failure, Jesus Christ has and will continue to build His Church. **Matthew 16:18**

**Progress, Reform and Study of History**
*“Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute, there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained... infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”* *The Life of Reason (1905-1906) – Vol. I. Reason in Common Sense* – George Santayana

**Why is it Important to Study Church History?**

- Study Church History so that we are not condemned to repeat the failures of others.
- Remember the toil, sacrifice and prayers of those who have led the way in the past.
- Follow them as they followed Christ, in the paths of humility, service and victory – even at the cost of their lives.

**Course Structure**

- Rigorous, challenging and profitable.
- Reading, writing and memorization.
- Memorize **Ephesians 4:11-16**.
- Pray daily that the Lord will sustain you and teach you.
- *"Apply your heart to discipline and your ears to words of knowledge."* **Proverbs 23:12**

**Knowledge**

- Blessings that come as we gain knowledge and understanding about God’s Word, will and Church.
- Be on guard against pride or arrogance because of our knowledge.
- Scripture warns us that knowledge can *“puff us up.”*
- Be aware that knowing and doing are, far too often, separate things in our experience.
- We are called to be those who hear (who learn) and those who do as well.
- Consider the times, conditions, limitations and challenges that those in the past faced in this battle for truth.
- So much of what we have – they did not have.

**Consider Your Own Growth**

- Consider your own history and growth in Christ.
- We all have made great changes from our early days of following Jesus and might be a little embarrassed if everyone knew what we were like then.

**Three Key Points**

- First - Keep Balanced:
    - There are balancing truths throughout Scripture.
    - It will become increasingly apparent that the hardest thing to do is to keep balanced; in doctrine, in practice, in lifestyle – in fact, in any and every area of our lives.
- Second - Not This Way Among You:
    - **Mark 10:41-45**, Jesus points His disciples to the way that the Gentiles build kingdoms and then tells them, *“But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;”* **Mark 10:43** (NASB).
    - The church has often ignored this command and has failed to build His kingdom or bring glory to our Lord and Savior.
    - Even today, we have forgotten our Lord’s command and have sought to build His kingdom (or more accurately – our own kingdoms) the way Gentiles build kingdoms: by force, by abusive authority, by self-promotion and by laws; rather than by changed lives through the power of God’s Spirit and God’s Word.
    - **Matthew 13:24-30 and 36-43**.
- Third - Contend for the Faith:
    - The churches, individually and collectively, have often failed to *“contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.”* **Jude 1:3**
    - Too many times, we have contended for our culture, our unbalanced teaching or for our positions of authority and influence, rather than for the truth entrusted to us.
    - When the Church faced challenges to her authority or teachings, from those inside or outside of the Church, we generally played the authority card. We responded by saying: *“Because I said so!”*
    - What was needed was a consistent, well-reasoned and biblical response.
    - There were significant times when the Church did just that, to our great benefit today.
    - However, we see the Church repeatedly using its power to try to crush any opposition or reform.

**Martin Luther**

- Quote from Martin Luther shows the Church the proper response.
- In April 1521, he appeared before Emperor Charles V to defend what he had taught and written.
- *“My conscience is captive to the word of God. Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I cannot and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen.”*
- Luther also said, *“Peace if possible, truth at all costs.”*

**Review**

- We looked at the importance of the study of Church History.
- We discussed the balancing truths throughout Scripture.
- We found the church has often failed to build His kingdom or bring glory to our Lord and Savior.
- We saw that churches, individually and collectively, have often failed to *“contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.”* **Jude 1:3**.

**In the Next Session**

- We will look at the use and meaning of the words: ekklesia and church.

| **Mark 10:43** | Christ redefines greatness through servanthood | *“But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;”* |
| **Mark 10:41–45** | Christ’s kingdom is not built like the Gentiles | *“Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John. Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, ‘You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.’”* |
| **Matthew 13:24–30** | Christ governs the growth and purity of His kingdom | *“Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away… Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”* |
| **Matthew 13:36–43** | Christ alone judges and separates at the end | *“Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, ‘Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.’ And He said, ‘The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man… The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness… Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father.’”* |
| **Jude 1:3** | Christ’s truth must be defended, not replaced | *“Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.”* |
| **Acts 20:28** | Christ purchased the Church with His blood | *“Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.”* |
| **Matthew 16:18** | Christ alone builds and preserves His Church | *“I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.”* |
| **Proverbs 23:12** | God commands disciplined learning | *“Apply your heart to discipline And your ears to words of knowledge.”* |
| **1 Corinthians 8:1** | Knowledge must submit to love | *“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.”* |

## Class Exercise

**Review the schedule and the assignments for this course with your students.**

*In class, or as an outside assignment, have your students write a summary of their current ideas, attitudes and understanding of the Church, so that, later they can compare them to their views at the end of this course. They need to be prepared to discuss how they may have changed at the end of the sessions on Ecclesiology (at the instructor’s discretion) and in their final paper.*

**My Current Understanding of the Church**

> At this point in my walk and studies, I understand the Church to have begun at Pentecost and to exist within the broader Age of the Gentiles. I believe the Church is a distinct body in God’s plan, separate from Israel and not a replacement for it. Scripture presents the Church as the Body of Christ and also as His Bride, with a specific role in God’s redemptive work during this present age, which will one day conclude.
>
> I currently see the Church as existing in two ways. There is the visible church, made up of churches, denominations, and people who profess Christianity. These visible expressions vary greatly in faithfulness to Scripture and spiritual health. At the same time, I believe there is a true or “invisible” Church made up of those who genuinely belong to Christ by faith. This group is known fully only to God and is not perfectly represented by any one organization or tradition.
>
> For me, true membership in the Church is not defined simply by attendance, affiliation, or outward profession, but by a genuine relationship with Christ that produces spiritual fruit. Those who truly belong to Him desire to know Him, trust Him, and follow Him, even when that becomes difficult or costly. While outward structures and traditions can be helpful, they are secondary to the inward work of God in the heart.
>
> I recognize that this understanding reflects where I am right now, and I expect that my views on the Church will be challenged, clarified, and refined as we study Ecclesiology in more depth. This summary represents my current perspective and gives me a starting point to evaluate how my thinking may grow or change by the end of this course.

*In class, or as an outside assignment, have your students put together a chart comparing the seven churches in Revelation 2-3. The purpose of the exercise is to realize that the Church has always needed reformation.*

**Place on the Chart:**

- How Jesus Christ is pictured?
- What does He know about each church?
- What commendation and/or rebuke is given to the churches?
- What are they commanded to do?
- What is the warning and/or promised blessing?
- What is the one thing that is said to all the churches.

*By the end of the course: Memorize **Ephesians 4:11-16** and recite it for 3 separate individuals or groups, on 3 separate occasions.*

**Reading assignments: Students will want to begin work on these assignments right away.**

*“In Church History in Plain Language,”* students need to come to class having read the chapters to be covered and having written a summary of each chapter in the section. The lengths of the summaries are at the discretion of the student and they need to be ready to share their summaries in the class discussion.

In *“The History of Christian Doctrines,”* students need to come to class having read the sections to be covered and having written a summary of each Roman numeral subject in the section(s). The lengths of the summaries are at the discretion of the student and they need to be ready to share their summaries in the class discussion.
