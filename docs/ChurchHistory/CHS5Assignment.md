bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.66-81)*

You will KNOW:

- The value of studying church history.

You will BE ABLE TO:

- Explain the extraordinary spread of the Gospel in the age of catholic (universal) Christianity.

You will THINK ABOUT:

- The benefits and challenges in studying church history.

**In the Last Session**

- You gained and understanding of the basic structures used for Church organization and government.
- You examined the Scriptures that relate to church organization and government.
- Are now able to explain the need for Church organization

**Begin video.**

**Historical Amnesia**

- Bruce Shelley asserts, in the prologue of our text, *Church History in Plain Language* – *“Many Christians today suffer from historical amnesia.”*
    - I would ask, *“Is it amnesia or ignorance?”*
- Let me refresh your memory of a statement I shared with you at the beginning of this course.
    - *“Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute, there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained... infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”*
- The good news is that you do not have to remember every person and every date to remember the past. You just need to gain a foundation and a perspective that is provided by the study of Church history.

**Benefits from the Study of Church History**

- One benefit could be described as – an explanation of the present.
    - We gain an answer to the question: How did we get here?
    - History gives us context and context is king – not only in our study of the Scriptures, but in all of life.
    - When we learn of the sacrifices and struggles of our fellow believers through the ages, we gain an appreciation of their efforts.
    - In humility realize that we are where we are because of their work and their prayers.
    - We stand on their shoulders to see what we see.
- When we study Church history or any history, we gain a confirmation of God’s presence throughout history.
    - If we are not considering the work of God in the affairs of men, then we are missing the point.
    - Perhaps you have heard this true saying, *“History is really His Story.”*
- An ability to recognize and correct reoccurring error comes to us when we study history.
    - I can think of nothing we face today, in relation to error and truth that the Church has not already faced in the past.
    - Solomon said it well: **Eccl 1:9** – *“That which has been is that which will be, and that which has been done is that which will be done. So, there is nothing new under the sun.”*
    - The question we must ask is – What did the Church do or say about that?
- There is an encouraging edification as we discover how God has worked in the lives of believers throughout history.
    - God did that for them and He did, or will do, the same kind of thing for us.
    - When we see God’s power, grace and work in others, we are encouraged and hopeful.
- The church has had an amazing influence on this world. We have not always done what we should but it is not hard to imagine what this world and our culture would be like without the Church – without salt and light.
- In our next section, on the development of Christian doctrine, the foundation of the history of the Church will be invaluable to our understanding of the process and the pressures that helped the Church wrestle with the truth and deliver it to our generation.
- Anytime we study history, we have the benefit of compressing time.
    - In today’s session, we are going to cover 300 years of history.
    - Consider what has happened in our country over the past 300 years.
    - The complexity and volume of information is overwhelming but as we gain understanding, we can summarize the essentials and learn the lessons of history.
- As we learn from the failures and successes of others, we gain the opportunity to correct our own course, get ourselves back on track, not only as an individual but hopefully also, as a church.

**Several Branches of Church History**
There are also several branches of church history that would yield good fruit.

- The branch of Politics would show us how the relationship between Church and State has played out over the years and make us aware of the dangers involved.
- The branch of Polity, the study of the structures of church government will reveal many lessons that would help us govern the Church today.
- The branch of Propagation, the when, where and how of the spread of Christianity would be a treasure trove of lessons and of gratitude that it spread to us.
- The branch of Persecution, the history of Christian martyrs – that continues to this day – produces a fruit that seems bitter but eventually becomes sweet and gives us strength.
- The branch of Polemics produces a fruit that strengthens our faith as we relish the development of doctrine and the answers given to combat heresies.
- The Praxis (practical or practice) branch of history helps us move forward as we see how the Church has influenced each culture and the world over all. The example of good works and sacrificial love stimulate us to follow their example.
- The branch of Presentation shows us the old ways and fresh ways to express our worship, which should result in a church filled with those who worship in spirit and in truth.

**Questions**

- Our interpretation of church history should consider the geography and political situation of each area. We must also answer several questions.
    - Who are the people who were prominent during any era?
    - What was the society or culture like?
    - What was the availability and level of education of the people?
    - What was the financial status of the people, the state, and the Church?
    - Were the Scriptures readily available?
    - Was the Bible in a language that people could easily understand?

**Issues**

- In any study of history, we should address a few problem areas, or issues, as well.
- There is the issue of what material do you consider.
- The subjective selection of authors to read, events to cover and people to highlight all come into play.
    - When I taught this class the first time, one of the students had just finished a church history class at a local Christian college. The people and events that we covered were not the ones she covered in her class. We cannot cover everything.
- There is also the issue of information degradation.
- There is a constant re-writing and re-interpreting of historical events, which can clarify the truth or muddy the waters.
- There is the mixture of tradition with reality.
- Tradition is not necessarily wrong, it is just not certain.
- The only history that we can have complete confidence in is the history recorded in the Bible.
- Only God knows absolute objective history.
- We also should realize that all of us take the information we learn and then filter it through our background and experiences and sometimes come to some very subjective conclusions.
- One of the benefits of discussing what we have learned in our study is that it tends to sharpen our perspective and understanding.
- **Proverbs 27:17**, *“As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.”*

### Three Negative Factors

Finally, I want us to consider *Three Factors that have affected the Church in a negative way*.

- First – the Secularization of the Church:
    - The union of the Church and the State under Constantine was thought to be a great opportunity for the Church but the subjugation of the Church to the State turned out to be disastrous.
    - When multitudes of citizens were baptized as Christians, without the work of the Holy Spirit, true Christianity and the Church were seriously compromised.

- Second – the Paganization of the Church:
    - The term often used is: *“syncretism.”*
    - Syncretism refers to the attempted reconciliation or union of different or opposing principles, practices, or parties, as in philosophy or religion.
    - One example was the Church’s accommodation of these new, non-Christian church members by taking their pagan “holy” days and dressing them up as Christian holidays. Perhaps most damaging was the introduction of idols, icons and relics.

- Third – the Sacramentalization of the Church:
    - The church adopted ceremonies and sacred acts that they taught would confer grace to the Church member, when administered by the duly ordained priest.
    - These were considered efficacious or powerful in and of themselves and some were considered necessary for salvation.

For the rest of this session, you will spend time discussing what you’ve learned and what you’ve written in your summaries of each of the *eight chapters in the Age of Jesus and the Apostles* and the *Age of Catholic Christianity*.

You will not only have the opportunity to share your insights, but you will also gain from the insights of your classmates.

**Review**

- Do we face historical amnesia or ignorance? The benefits of studying history:
    - Understanding the Present
    - Seeing God’s Presence
    - Recognition of Error
    - Encouragement
    - Perspective

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will be discussing the *eight chapters in The Age of The Christian Roman Empire*.

## Key Verses

## Class Exercise

### INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: AGE OF CATHOLIC CHRISTIANITY

Don’t forget to ask your students to recite **Ephesians 4:11-16** at any time during this course.

The plan for this class is that it would be filled with discussion and interaction. I would encourage you to have your students share their summaries with the class. This will give them the experience of “being up front” or at least speaking in public.

Time constraints, the number of students and the length of their summaries may limit the number who could share regarding each chapter. I have also included a few questions connected with certain chapters. They are intended to advance discussion and help us make application to our own lives and ministries. I have included my summaries of each chapter as an example – not as the perfect example. These summaries help with the learning process. The students will have read the chapters before class. Then they will come to class having written their own summaries. In the video, I will review the section to be covered in each class. Finally, you and the class will review and discuss the summaries they (& I) have written. Repetition with variety is essential to learning. Four times: reading, writing, hearing and discussing should give them a good grasp of the information available. If you get through the discussion early, that is acceptable – as long as the material is covered.

### Some of The Early Church Fathers

**Clement of Rome - AD 97**

- Wrote to inspire UNITY in Local Church (Corinth)
- Visible Church expressed as Local Church
- Invisible Church created before Sun and Moon

**Ignatius - AD 100 - Bishop of Antioch**

- Visible Local congregation presided over by a Bishop
- Coined: *“the katholike ekklesia”* The Catholic Church
- His writings use *“ekklesia”* 77% as Local

**Irenaeus - AD 170 - Bishop of Lyons**

- Universal Church as Divine Custodian of Truth
- Succession of Bishops from Christ
- Salvation only within Catholic Church
- In *“Against Heresies”* used *“ekklesia”* 83% as Universal

**Cyprian - AD 250 - Bishop of Carthage**

- Unity of Universal Church and Authority of Bishops
- Doctrine of Episcopacy - congregation of Bishops
- *“You cannot have God for Father unless Church is Mother”*
- Roman Bishop prime among equals (Peter as rock)

**Augustine - AD 400 - Bishop of Hippo**

- ekklesia rarely used as local
- Reinforced Sacramental System
- Baptism in Catholic Church necessary for Salvation
- *“Corpus Mixtum”* (A Mixed Body) from the *“wheat/tares parable.”*

**Three Factors that Brought about the Degeneration of the Church:**

1. The Secularization of the Church  
   Union of Church & State under Constantine  
   Dilution of true Christianity with unbelievers

2. The Paganization of the Church  
   Accommodation of pagan *“holy”* days  
   Introduction of idols, icons & relics

3. The Sacramentalization of the Church  
   Sacred acts believed to *confer* grace  
       administered by the priesthood  
       efficacious in and of themselves  
       some necessary for salvation  

   Instead of: Memorials that commemorate grace  
       outward, symbolic, participatory  
       observed by those who are saved

**The Seven Sacraments of Roman Church**

1. Mass: a re-sacrificing of Christ by the priest.
2. Baptism: washes away original sin.
3. Marriage: under the control of the Church.
4. Ordination: widens the gulf between clergy & laity.
5. Confirmation: giving the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
6. Penance: payment imposed for the forgiveness of sins.
7. Extreme Unction: final rites for dying grace.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**

Foreword: (R.L. Hatchett)

The stated purpose of our textbook: *“Church History in Plain Language”* by Bruce Shelley, is to lead evangelical readers to engage their own story and to encounter the larger Christian world.

It is written for a popular audience, rather than an academic audience. He elected to tell representative stories that will give the reader a sense of the larger picture. If you are interested in any particular era, personality or movement, you will find suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter. There is considerable information available on the internet.

The major differences between this and previous editions of the textbook are the various *“highlighted”* sections, added to provide extra information. In addition, the focus and the content of the final three chapters are significantly different.
The author of the foreword hopes that no reader will miss the point that American evangelicals need a larger frame of reference to participate in the great kingdom work flourishing in the world today (outside of the West).

**Prologue – (Bruce Shelley)**

*“Many Christians today suffer from historical amnesia.”* Perhaps it would be more accurate to say: *“historical ignorance”?* Because of this forgetfulness, or ignorance, we find believers vulnerable to the appeals of cultists and false teaching. Far too often, we have welcomed distortions of Christianity as the real thing.

On the other end of the spectrum, we find that, without the advantage of a broader context for our work, we can develop a bad case of spiritual pride and simply repeat the same mistakes of previous generations.

We must answer the question, *“Is the church a movement or an institution?”* In this book, and I believe it is both. Some may not be happy with Bruce Shelley’s failure to set limits with a strict definition of the term *“church.”* However, we live in a tension between the ideal (the universal communion of the saints) and the specific (the particular people in a definite time and place).

The church’s mission in time calls for institutions. However, when institutions themselves obstruct the spread of the gospel, rather than advance it, then movements of renewal arise to return to the church’s basic mission in the world. These pages will illustrate how often that has happened.

1. Discuss the dangers we face by not knowing the history of the Church and the benefits we gain from studying Church history.

*“Many Christians suffer from historical amnesia.”* – Or is it just plain ignorance?

- Vulnerability to false teaching
- Tendency for spiritual pride
- Ministry without a broader context

We need to develop the ability to separate the transient from the permanent; the fads from the basics.

**Value of Church History**

- Explanation of present
- Confirmation of God’s presence
- Correction of recurring error
- Edification of believer in relation to early believers
- Illustration of Church’s role in human history
- Foundation of Systematic Theology
- Time compression
- Course correction

**Problems in the Study of History**

History - GK: *“historia”* – knowledge, understanding learned by inquiry or narrative

- Subjective Selection - We cannot cover everything
- Information Degradation - Only God knows absolute objective history
- Subjective Conclusions

## Section 1 - The Age of Jesus and the Apostles

**Chapter 1 – Away with the King!**

Christianity finds its roots in Jewish history. Chapter 1 covers the back story of the Church, including the life, teaching and crucifixion of Jesus. It includes the Jewish expectation of the Messiah, the Jewish resistance to Roman rule and the Jewish religious system’s rejection of Jesus as the Messiah.

This chapter covers most of what we generally know from the Gospels, along with information regarding the political and religious tensions that form the context of Jesus’ ministry, rejection and death.

**Chapter 2 – Wineskins: Old and New**

Chapter 2 takes us from the resurrection of Jesus to the destruction of Jerusalem. At first, the only Christians were Jewish and the Church faithfully lived and proclaimed the gospel with success, even amid persecution.

*“The Way”* was one of the names used to describe this movement but they also used the Greek word: *“ekklesia,”* which means, *“the assembly, or gathering”* (of the followers of Jesus).

There were several social, racial and cultural barriers to overcome in getting the message from Jerusalem and Judea to Samaria and to all the nations. (**Acts 1:8; Matthew 28:19-20**). The first struggle was between the *“old school”* Jews and the *“Hellenistic”* Jews, who were heavily influenced by the Greek culture and language. Then they had to cross over to the Samaritans (another semi-Jewish group) and then eventually to the Gentiles, and thus to the nations. (See the book of Acts)

The revolt against Rome and the destruction of Jerusalem, along with the dispersion of the Jews throughout the empire, closed Jerusalem as the center of Judaism and Christianity.

When the leaders of the Jerusalem church fled the city before its destruction, pious Jews considered their escape as an act of treason and for the most part closed the door to the Church’s inroads into the Jewish world.

**Prologue:**

**Away with The King:**

- The Jewish expectation of The Messiah
- The Jewish resistance to the rule of Rome

**Only Worthless People**

*“Catholic Christianity”*

- The Spread of the Faith: West of Antioch & Into North Africa
- *Villages were in most areas largely untouched!*
- The Social Impact of the Gospel

Quote by Celsus: page 35  
*“Far from us, say the Christians, be any man possessed of any culture of wisdom or judgment; their aim is to convince only worthless and contemptible people, idiots, slaves, poor women, and children...These are the only ones whom they manage to turn into believers.”*

## The Apologists: Reason & Scripture – books & letters

**Reasons for The Gospel’s Spread**

- A burning conviction re: the redemption of mankind by the Christians
- A felt need in the hearts of people (Stoicism (self-control) with Grace)
- The practical expression of Christian love – for their own & for others
- Persecution – martyrdoms (see chart #20)

**2. Discuss the implications of the reasons presented (above) for the spread of the gospel. How should this affect our service and ministry?**

**If the Tiber Floods**

- A noble army of martyrs
- Rome’s policy
- Reasons for persecution
    - Distinctive life-style
    - Rejection of pagan gods & pagan social events
    - Disasters blamed on the Christians
    - Sex & Slander
    - Refusal: *“Caesar is Lord”*

**Arguing About the Event**

- Christian Behavior without Christian Beliefs
- Orthodox? Faith & Theology (see page 50-51)
- False Gospels – irreconcilable differences through the doctrine of Christ – Ebionites & Docetism (*“Seemism”*)
- The Dangers of Gnosticism (*dualism*)
- C.S. Lewis: *“There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God.”*

**3. Discuss the C.S. Lewis quote above and the balance between seeking to live as a Christian and avoiding legalism.**

**The Rule of Books – See charts 17 & 18 in Charts book**

- The suppression of Christianity demanded the destruction of the Scriptures
- How we got the Bible (Biblia = plural vs. Bible = singular)
- The Apocrypha vs. The Canon
- Self-evidencing
    - Used in Christian Worship
    - Ties to an Apostle
- Marcion, with his rejection of all but Paul, & Montanus, with his ecstatic prophetic utterances, forced the churches into thinking about closing the canon – (see chart on page 73)

**The School for Sinners**

- Forgiveness of sins after salvation & baptism?
- Sin among the leaders (Bishops)
- Bishops & Elders (Pastors) & Deacons
- Intentional, willful, sinful departure from the divinely authorized pattern
- Exercised liberty in the absence of any divinely authorized pattern
- Directed by the Holy Spirit, even as earlier leaders were proof of the Spirit’s power, not in the office, but in the life!
- Athenagoras: (page 79)  
  *“Among us are uneducated folk, artisans, and old women who are utterly unable to describe the value of our doctrines in words, but who attest them by their deeds.”*
- Unforgivable sins by the church?
    - Sexual immorality
    - Murder
    - Denial of the faith
- Martyrs, Confessors & Saints
- System for readmission/forgiveness – by the Bishop? (penance)

**Apostles to Intellectuals**

- Jerome - Ciceronian vs. Christian
- Tension of separation from and penetration of the world
- Clever, eloquently defended heresy vs. dull, narrow-minded orthodoxy
- Clement & Origen confronted the philosophy of their age with the truth of God’s Word.
- Page 91: The persistent tendency of heresy, whether ancient or contemporary, is to lay hold upon a few impressive texts and to wrench some rigid and erroneous interpretation of from these. This Origen would not allow. He wanted the whole Bible to speak, because he knew that what the Bible taught in its entirety are the central Christian truths of catholic Christianity.

**4. Discuss the work of Origen & Clement as they wrestled with the tension of separation from and penetration of the world. What did they do that we should be doing? What did they do that we should not be doing? (pages 86-93)**

Tertullian of Carthage took Paul’s words in **Colossians 2:8** to heart: *“See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.”*

Clement & Origen of Alexandria also sought to follow Paul’s teaching and example in **1 Corinthians 9:19-23**. Verse 22 – *“…I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some.”* We certainly should be on guard according to **Colossians 2:8** as we live and minister in this fallen world.

I should be more interested in winning people to Christ than an argument!

I should not give in to speculation, trying to answer questions or issues when I have no sure light. Remember **Deuteronomy 29:29**!
