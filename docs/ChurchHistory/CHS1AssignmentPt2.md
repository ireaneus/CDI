## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.23-31)*

You will KNOW:

- That the Church is an assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting.

You will BE ABLE TO:

- Discuss that the concept of the Church began with Jesus Christ.

You will THINK ABOUT:

- Why the term ekklesia is used by Jesus in only two passages of Matthew? **Matthew 16:18; 18:17**

**In the Last Session**

- We looked at the importance of the study of Church History is so that we will not be condemned to repeat the past.
- You also learned the three lessons that will help keep you from repeating the mistakes of the past.
    - Keep Balanced
    - Not this way among you = not the way of the Gentiles. **Mark 10:43**
    - Contend for the faith = not our culture or traditions.

**Understanding the Church**

- Church - The Greek word that is translated *“church”* or *“churches”* is: (Strong’s Number G1577). Ecclesia – ekklēsia (ek-klay-see'-ah) a gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place, an assembly.

**The Church in the New Testament**

- Church in the New Testament describes:
    - An assembly of the people convened at the public place of the council for the purpose of deliberating.
    - The assembly of the Israelites.
    - Any gathering or throng of men assembled by chance, tumultuously.
- In a Christian sense, church is used to signify:
    - An assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting.
    - A company of Christians hoping for eternal salvation through Jesus Christ, to observe their own religious rites, to hold their own religious meetings, and to manage their own affairs, according to regulations prescribed for the body for order's sake.
    - Those who anywhere, (in a city or village), constitute such a company and are united into one body.
    - The whole body of Christians scattered throughout the earth.
    - The assembly of faithful Christians already dead and received into heaven.

**Ekklesia Was a Political Term**

- In classical usage ekklesia was a political term, meaning *“an assembly of duly summoned citizens.”*
- In the Greek city-state, the trumpet of the herald summoned the citizens to the ekklesia (assembly) to hear of and deal with the business of the city.
- Ekklesia is often seen as an exclusive term, connecting its meaning with the fact that only citizens were being called to the meeting.
- In common usage, ekklesia was an inclusive word. Comes from the verb, *“to call out or call forth.”*
- Herald calling the people living in a certain place, to come to a meeting. The *“assembly of duly summoned citizens”* eventually became just *“an assembly.”*

**The Jewish Background**

- The use of ekklesia in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, can be instructive.
- Occurs about 80 times in the Septuagint, translating the Hebrew word qahal (kha-hale) or words from the same root.
- Qahal is one of the primary words for a gathering or assembly.
- The assembly gained meaning from the context, from the people or purpose of the meeting. It is rarely, if ever translated by the Greek word: *“synagogue.”* *‘Edah* (ay-daw) is the word most often translated by synagogue in the Septuagint.
- When applied to Israel, *‘edah* came to indicate the society itself, whether assembled or not.
- It is used of the children of Israel, during their journey from Egypt to Canaan.
- *‘Edah* assumes a sort of technical status as the People of God, but qahal continues to denote only the actual assembly or meeting.
- By the first century, the word synagogue had assumed too much of a technical status, to use among the Christians, since it most often identified the religious assemblies of the Jews, the Jews themselves and the places where they assembled.

**Ekklesia in the New Testament**

- The pre-Christian history of the ekklesia presented the new institution of Jesus Christ with an easily adaptable word to describe that institution.
- A neutral term, devoid of any special doctrinal significance.
- This word that meant *“assembly”* now included the people who assembled, whether in an assembly or not.
- This assembly was something real; the first and most common usage was of a local church, e.g., where there was an assembling of the people.
- This usage is typical of the New Testament and of many of the passages in the Apostolic Fathers.
- It had become in most of these passages the technical term to designate this new institution.
- There developed a wider, non-local use. The church, after spreading out from Jerusalem, was still in all these places the same institution of Jesus Christ. The word ekklesia did not lend itself to this non-local usage.
- To emphasize the oneness of these churches, the singular was used and so the idea of assembly was no longer exclusive.
- The concept of the Church began with Jesus Christ. The word ekklesia became what it was because of Jesus Christ; for it became the technical term of that institution which assembled in His name, and which was composed of people who sustained a certain relationship to Him, e.g., people *“in Christ.”*
- Jesus taught about and preached the Kingdom of God.
- *When the modern conflict between The Kingdom and The Church is removed, the ekklesia is a realization of this teaching.*
- Church does not exhaust the meaning of the Kingdom of God (the sovereignty or reign of God).
- One anonymous author stated it this way: *“The Kingdom creates a community, and uses a community as an instrument. Those who enter the Kingdom are in the Church; the Church lives beneath the Kingly Rule of God, acknowledges it, proclaims it, and looks for its final manifestation; but the Church is not itself the Kingdom.”*

**Where Did We Get the Word Church?**

- The English word *“church”* comes from the Greek adjective: *“kyriakos”* (koori-ah-'khaus) which means: *“the Lord’s”* (e.g., belonging to or related to the Lord.)
- It may refer to the Lord’s people in general or to any group of the Lord’s people.
- From the third century, it began to be used to refer to the building in which the Lord’s people worship.
- This word does not appear in the New Testament in any context in which it can be translated church.
- It occurs only twice: **1 Corinthians 11:20** – *“The Lord’s supper”* and in **Revelation 1:10** – *“the Lord’s day.”*
- It is easy to see that those in an assembly would want to clarify and distinguish themselves from a political rally or some generic gathering of a crowd – *“we are the ekklesia Kyriakos”* = the gathering of the Lord’s people.
- It may have been the intention of the early church to use *“the Lord’s”* to designate the Church as *“those who belong to Jesus Christ”* and even to emphasize that our *“citizenship is in heaven.”* **Phil 3:20**
- Words tend to adjust or adapt over time and the original meaning changes into something more generic or functional; so that now – for many people – *“church”* means a building, a worship service, or a religious group of any kind.
- Pastor Ken Ainsworth gave us a simple definition of the Church in our Christian Doctrine class.
- Use his definition of the local church for our baseline. Other definitions are included with your notes.
- *“The local Church (visible) is a group of believers called to assemble, to worship and to minister (serve) in a single community.”*
- This simple foundation is a good place to begin building our understanding of the Church.

**Review**

- The *“Ekklesia”* are citizens who are called together to deal with the business of the kingdom and is used to describe those called together by Christ to take care of His business.
- The *“Church”* are those who are identified as *“belonging to the Lord.”*

**In the Next Session**

- We will look at the descriptions or pictures of the Church in the New Testament.
- We will look at some word pictures used in the New Testament that describe the relationship between Christ and His church.
- We will also be able to explain the significance of those pictures.

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: UNDERSTANDING THE CHURCH**

If they have not already done so, have your students finish the chart of the seven churches in Revelation 2-3 (part of the purpose of the assignment is to reinforce the idea, that the Church is always in need of reformation and course correction).

Conduct the following class discussion. Throughout this guide book many of these questions have the answers underneath to help you guide the discussions. But many times, these questions are not answered, hoping the course materials and the required reading will help you guide the discussions.

1. What is the use and meaning of the words: Ekklesia and Church?

    > The *“Ekklesia”* are citizens who are called together to deal with the business of the kingdom and is used to describe those called together by Christ to take care of His business.  
    > The *“Church”* are those who are identified as *“belonging to the Lord.”*

2. Read these definitions and be prepared to discuss. What are the common elements used and what are the differences? What, if any, are the elements that you believe are neglected? Unnecessary?

    > **David Hocking:** The church is a universal body of believers, which manifests itself through various local assemblies of believers. (*The World’s Greatest Church* – page 97)
    >
    > **John MacArthur:** The Church is an assembly of called out ones. Those who love Jesus Christ constitute the true church, the Body of Christ. We belong to the collective Body of Christ, whether we are alive or in glory. The church is made up of people called by God to be His children. We have become united with all other believers by faith in Christ. – The world cannot detect the invisible church of real Christians. They see only the visible church, which includes those who only profess to be Christians. The Lord intended to establish a visible church for a testimony to the world. In the book of Acts the invisible church became more visible. (*The Master’s Plan for the Church* – pages 81-82)

    > **Charles Ryrie:** Taking together the features of local churches we see in the New Testament, we might propose the following definition: A local church is an assembly of professing believers in Christ who have been baptized and who are organized to do God’s will. (*A Survey of Bible Doctrine* – page 141)
    >
    > The universal church is that spiritual organism of which Christ is the Head and believers from Pentecost to the rapture are the members.  (*A Survey of Bible Doctrine* – page 154-155)
    >
    > **J. Oliver Buswell:** - *“The visible church, which is also catholic or universal...consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion together with their children; and is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation.”*
    >
    > *“The catholic or universal church which is invisible consists of the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all.”*  (Both taken from the Westminster Confession of Faith XXV)  (*A Systematic Theology of the Christian Religion Vol.1 Chapter 6 – page 418 & Vol.2 Chapter 8 page 216)

**3. In the Gospels, Ekklesia is found only in Matthew, and in only two passages in that gospel (16:18; 18:17). What did Jesus say about the Ekklesia in Matthew 16:18?**

I will build My church (The Promise)  
I will build My church (The Identity)

**4. Why is it used only twice in the gospels?**

(*Two possible answers are below. Can you think of any other possible answers? – see **Ephesians 3:1-13**).*  
This term seems to be generally reserved for the time after the resurrection-ascension of Jesus Christ. Note, for instance, that in Luke-Acts ekklesia never occurs until after the events of Pentecost. There is an understanding that ekklesia is, strictly speaking, a post-resurrection institution.

Another possibility is that Jesus himself gave the term ekklesia its new significance, either on this occasion (**Mt.16:18**), or elsewhere in his ministry. A definition in Messianic terms would give it the depth of meaning expected in this passage. The connection of church and kingdom in **Mt. 16:18-19** might suggest that Jesus made such a definition.

**5. Where is the word ekklesia used most often in the New Testament?**  
Review the information on the use of the word ekklesia in the rest of the New Testament and discuss how this should affect our view of the Church.

In the book of Acts, ekklesia is used 23 times. In two instances (**19:32, 40**) it refers to the mob of people at Ephesus. In this passage (**19:39**) it is also used to refer to the assembly which met regularly or lawfully at Ephesus. Once ekklesia is used in the speech of Stephen (**7:38**) to designate the children of Israel gathered at Sinai.

It comes closest to its classical usage in **14:27** where the assembly is gathered at Antioch to hear Paul and Barnabas. In the remaining passages, ekklesia means more than the actual assembly, it means the people who assemble. For example, we read *“great fear came over the whole church”* in Jerusalem (**5:11**); a *“great persecution began against the Church in Jerusalem”* (**8:1**) and *“Saul began ravaging the Church, entering house after house”* (**8:3**). In nearly every case, ekklesia is used in a local sense: it is the assembly (assembled or not) at Jerusalem (**11:22; 12:1, 5; 15:4, 22**), at Antioch (**11:26; 13:1; 14:27; 15:3**), at Caesarea (**18:22**), and at Ephesus (**20:17, 28**). This local use is emphasized using the plural, ekklesiai, when referring to churches in a larger area: in Syria and Cilicia (**15:41**) and in areas of Asia Minor (**16:5**).

The possible exceptions to the local use: *“churches”* is the statement in **9:31**: *“So the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up”* and in **15:41**, where a textual variant has the singular: *“Church.”* This is the beginning of another development in the meaning of ekklesia: the universal usage. If the singular reading is correct, and ekklesia is used in a universal sense, then we have the local and universal usage here side by side in the book of Acts. In this development, ekklesia can mean any portion of Christians: from a local group to those in a larger geographical area, and, by extension, to those throughout the world.

It is in Paul's letters to the Ephesians and Colossians that ekklesia received its fullest doctrinal expression. We have seen ekklesia used to designate the people, whether assembled or not. However, in most cases, the use was still local; these people could and were assembling. Nevertheless, in Ephesians and Colossians the use of ekklesia is about the people without respect to the possibility of assembling.

The term itself was rather neutral – not particularly expressive of the doctrine concerning that institution. In the letters to Ephesus and Colossae ekklesia is grounded into the doctrine of the Church and made to carry the doctrinal implications. Paul did this by using two important parallel terms, the body and the wife.

**6. Read the paragraphs below and discuss the benefits or problems of using the word “Kyriakos,” which we translate as: “Church.”**

The English word: “church” comes from the Greek adjective: “kyriakos” (koori-ah-khaus) which means: “the Lord’s” (e.g., belonging to or related to the Lord.) It may refer to the Lord’s people in general or to any group of the Lord’s people. From the third century, at least, it began to be used to refer to the building in which the Lord’s people worship. This word does not appear in the New Testament in any context in which it can be translated church. It occurs only twice: **1 Corinthians 11:20** – *“The Lord’s supper”* and in **Revelation 1:10** – *“the Lord’s day.”*

It is easy to see that those in an assembly would want to clarify and distinguish themselves from a political rally or some generic gathering of a crowd – thus, *“we are the ekklesia Kyriakos”* equals the gathering of the Lord’s people.

It may have been the intention of the early church to use “the Lord’s” to designate the Church as *“those who belong to Jesus Christ”* and even to emphasize that our *“citizenship is in heaven.”* **Philippians 3:20**

However, words tend to adjust or adapt over time and the original meaning changes into something more generic or functional; so that now – for many people – “church” means a building, a worship service, or a religious group of any kind.
