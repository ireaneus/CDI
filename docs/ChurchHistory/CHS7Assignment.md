bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.97-111)*

You will KNOW:

- How and why the popes gained so much power during the Middle Ages.

You will BE ABLE TO:

- Explain the motivations for the Crusades, as well as their scope and sequence.

You will THINK ABOUT:

- The challenges faced by the Church during the Middle Ages.

**In the Last Session**

- We discussed the benefits and consequences of the union between Church and State.
- Learned the importance and the challenges of the Church councils in establishing orthodoxy.
- Talked about the pull and peril of the monastic ideal.

**Begin video.**

**The Christian Middle Ages**

- Often referred to as “The Dark Ages,” covered nearly 1,000 years of church history.
    - *Though this section in our textbook has only seven chapters and 72 pages of reading, many of my students have expressed the sense that it seemed to be extremely long – they thought they would never get to the end. It created in them a great appreciation for the Reformation that followed.*
- The Middle Ages began as a time of great turmoil, instability and change.
- The Church sought to establish order and security in the West – to reestablish the Roman Empire as the “Holy Roman Empire.”
- Students of the history of the Church in the Middle Ages are not the only ones who felt the darkness.
- Before the Reformation gained strength and acceptance, there were many voices crying out to God and calling upon the Church for change.
- Europe, along with the rest of western civilization, owes more to the Christian faith than most people realize.

**Christendom (the Kingdom of God on Earth)**

- When the barbarians destroyed the Roman Empire in the West, it was the Christian church that put together a new order called Europe.
- The church took the lead in rule by law, the pursuit of knowledge and the expressions of culture.
- The underlying concept was Christendom (the Kingdom of God on earth), which united empire and church.
- It began under Charlemagne in the 8th century, but the popes slowly assumed more and more power until Pope Innocent III, at the beginning of the 13th century, taught Europe to think of the popes as world rulers.
- In later centuries, we see the popes corrupted by power and false teaching.
- We also see increasingly militant reformers cry out for change.
- The popes, as the leaders of the Church, were facing a time of chaos.
- With no central government in place, things were changing and we all know how much the Church resists change – even in our day!
- There was a longing for the “good old days” and for the unity of the Roman Empire, which had a powerful appeal to most people.

**What Did Christianity Bring to the Devastation?**

- What did Christianity bring to the devastation, to bring order out of the chaos and help erect a new order called Christian Europe?
- Well, the Church was the only surviving vestige of organized civilization in the West; it was the anchor for the empire.

**Gregory, The Reluctant**

- Into this turmoil, an unlikely monk named Gregory was elected as pope in 590 AD.
- Gregory “the Reluctant” eventually became Gregory “the Great.”
- His gifts for administration were invaluable in stabilizing the Church and the region, but his practical approach to the “defense of orthodoxy” led him to include unbiblical teachings, even crude, superstitious and pagan notions of the illiterate population in what he would declare to be “the faith.”

**Charles the Great – Charlemagne**

- One hundred sixty years later, Charles the Great – Charlemagne – became the emperor and restored the Christian Empire to the West.
- He had three goals:
    - military power to crush his enemies
    - religious power to direct his people’s souls
    - intellectual power to instruct both souls and minds
- This reunion of Church and State affected the course of European politics and Christianity for centuries.

**Islamic Conquest**

- About this same time the Muslim prophet, Muhammad died and the Islamic conquest began of the Middle East, North Africa, present day Turkey and Spain.
- This eventually caused problems for pilgrims visiting the Holy Land and raised fears that Muslims might even conquer Europe.
- *This contributed to the creation of the Crusades.*
- By the 8th century, 50% of all Christians lived under Islamic rule.
- Charts 38 and 39 in our Charts book provide a good summary of the scope and sequence of the crusades and the Muslim conquests.
- Unfortunately, the popes never held two basic truths:
    - First, Christianity’s highest satisfactions are not guaranteed by possession of special places or things (relics).
    - Second, the sword is never the way God extends Christ’s church. (See **Mark 10:42–45**)

**The Scholars and Scholasticism**

- As the Church entered the second millennium, the Church also entered the era of Scholasticism.
- The schools in the cathedrals (initiated by Charles the Great) gave birth to medieval universities, with the supreme task of understanding and explaining the light of revealed truth.
- Scholasticism was a distinctive method of scholarship combined with the unique theology of the Middle Ages.
- The purpose was to reconcile Christian doctrine with human reason and arrange the teachings of the Church in an orderly system.
- However, the free search for truth was never in view, since the chief doctrines of the Christian faith were regarded as fixed.
- The purpose of the discussion was to show the reasonableness of the doctrines and to explain their implications.
- Living religiously in a studious manner was a hallmark of medieval education.
- The curriculum of the cathedral school was limited to the seven liberal arts:
    - Grammar
    - Rhetoric
    - Logic
    - Arithmetic
    - Geometry
    - Music
    - Astronomy
- They were called the “liberal” arts because they were originally reserved for men who were liberal, that is, liberated, free, not slaves.
- Scholasticism came to stand for painstaking arrival at logical conclusions through:
    - Questioning
    - Examining
    - Arranging details into a system of logic.
- As students learned to think, unquestioning acceptance of traditional authorities was no longer assured but the conclusions had to agree with Christian doctrine.
- *That which had been put forward as the truth of God was now being tested by fire, with the wood, hay and stubble starting to burn.*

**An Opportunity**

- Here was an opportunity to provide a biblical, reasoned response to just about any issue.
- It was also an opportunity to sort through what was truly Christian doctrine and what were the doctrines of men.
- There were a growing number of teachers, monks and others who were responding to the abuses and excesses of the Church with new movements and teachings towards a renewal, a reform for the Church.
- The medieval poverty movement, for one example, is a timeless reminder that political Christianity is, at best, only partial Christianity – and some might justly say, “Is not Christianity!”
- Some of these movements were indeed misguided, even heretical in their theology and practices – but not all.
**Weapons of War?**
- What were weapons the Catholic Church could use, to deal with these renewal and reform movements?
- There were three solutions:
    - Preach the word to return to the truth.
    - Lead a crusade to crush all hardened resistance.
    - Establish the Inquisition to uproot heresy completely.
- The Inquisition was their primary response.

**An Unstable Foundation**

- The philosophical framework supporting a papal monarchy was built on an unstable foundation of cannon law and a systematic statement of Christian theology that had very little Scriptural support.
- “Canon law” simply refers to “Church law.”
- The rules, regulations and practices established by the Church. We could compare it to the by-laws in our church constitutions.
- The craving to control, the zeal to reach every aspect of life disguised the fatal flaw in Christianity by law.
- It tried to reduce human freedom to a miserable minimum and forgot that God designed freedom as the forerunner for the coming of true faith.
- Like the crusades, scholastic theology reached too far and claimed too much for itself and the Church.
- The reformers were soon to become protestors – Protestants.

**Review**

- The Middle Ages were the Dark Ages because of the chaos in the Empire and the chaos in the Church.
- The Church was trying to restore the stability of the Empire and maintain power for itself.
- The unstable foundations and the indefensible teachings were being tested and exposed for what they were – man’s work and ideas, not God’s.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will be discussing the eight chapters in “The Age of The Reformation.”

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE MIDDLE AGES**

For the rest of this session your students will spend time discussing what they have learned and what they have written in their summary of each of the eight chapters in “The Christian Empire.”

They will have the opportunity to share their insights, but they will also gain from the insights of their classmates.

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters. Due to time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group.

You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Church History in Plain Language**  
by Bruce Shelley  

**The Christian Middle Ages – 590–1517 AD**

Europe, and Western Civilization, owes more to the Christian faith than most people realize. When the barbarians destroyed the Roman Empire in the West, it was the Christian church that put together a new order called Europe. The church took the lead in rule by law, the pursuit of knowledge and the expressions of culture. The underlying concept was Christendom, which united empire and church. It began under Charlemagne in the eighth century, but the popes slowly assumed more and more power until Innocent III (1198–1216) taught Europe to think of the popes as world rulers. Later centuries, however, saw the popes corrupted by power (and by false teaching) and increasingly militant reformers cry out for change.

## Question 1

**What did Christianity bring to the devastation, to bring order out of the chaos, to erect a new order called Christian Europe?**

Christianity brought order out of the chaos that followed the collapse of the Roman Empire by providing stability, meaning, and continuity when no other institution could. The Church preserved law, learning, and moral structure, while Augustine’s vision of the City of God helped people understand suffering and history within God’s sovereign plan. Through shared faith, leadership, and education, Christianity unified fragmented peoples and laid the foundation for a new social order known as Christian Europe.

## Question 2

**How could/did the kingdom that Jesus said was “not of the world" become such a part of worldly power?**

Although Jesus taught that His kingdom is *“not of this world,”* it became closely tied to worldly power through historical, political, and practical pressures. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Church was the only surviving institution capable of providing structure, while rulers needed spiritual legitimacy to govern fragmented territories. This mutual dependence led to an alliance in which the pope required protection and rulers, especially Charlemagne, sought divine sanction. Charlemagne’s vision combined *military strength*, *religious authority*, and *intellectual reform*, blending Christian faith with imperial governance.

## Question 3

**Question 3 — Should the church rule the state, or the state control the church?**

I do not believe the church should rule the state, nor should the state control the church. History shows that when either happens, both are distorted. While the Cluniac reformers and Gregory VII were right to insist that the **spiritual must have primacy over the secular**, the attempt to place society under papal control went beyond biblical teaching. Scripture affirms distinct roles: the state is ordained by God to restrain evil and maintain order, while the church is called to proclaim the gospel, disciple believers, and remain faithful to Christ. True unity among people is not achieved through political power or religious control, but only through **Christ and obedience to the Word of God**. The church best serves society not by ruling it, but by bearing faithful witness to truth, calling rulers to moral accountability, and living as a distinct kingdom within the world rather than over it.

## Question 4

**Discuss the Crusades and consider what our answers should be to those who challenge Christianity’s hypocrisy because of the Crusades.**

The Crusades represent a tragic chapter in church history where political ambition, fear, and religious zeal became intertwined, leading to actions that contradicted the clear teachings of Jesus. While the Crusades were often justified as defensive efforts to protect pilgrims or reclaim sacred territory, they quickly devolved into campaigns marked by violence, coercion, and, at times, attacks on fellow Christians. These actions stand in sharp contrast to Christ’s teaching that His kingdom is not advanced by the sword and that greatness in His kingdom is defined by servanthood, not domination (*Mark 10:42–45*).

When faced with accusations of Christian hypocrisy because of the Crusades, our response should be one of *truthful acknowledgment rather than defensiveness*. The Church itself has long recognized the Crusades as inconsistent with the gospel, and later generations of Christians have confessed the sins committed in Christ’s name. It is important to distinguish between *Christ and Christendom*—between the teachings of Jesus and the political misuse of Christianity by church and state leaders. The failures of the Crusades do not invalidate Christianity; rather, they reveal what happens when the Church departs from Christ’s example and attempts to establish God’s kingdom through worldly power. True Christianity advances not by force, but by faithful witness, repentance, and love for enemies.

## Question 5

**What was missing from the cathedral school curriculum of grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy?**

What was missing from the cathedral school curriculum was the centrality of Scripture itself. While students were trained extensively in the liberal arts—grammar, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, music, and astronomy—these disciplines became tools for reasoning about faith rather than being grounded directly in *the Bible as the primary authority*. Theology was approached more through philosophical systems and inherited traditions than through careful, direct study of Scripture. As a result, learning often emphasized intellectual structure and logical coherence over biblical exposition and spiritual formation, leaving the Word of God secondary instead of foundational.

## Question 6

**Discuss the difference between *“Christianity by law”* (Legalism or State Religion would be Christianity by law) and *“Human freedom as the forerunner for the coming of true faith.”***

In my view, *“Christianity by law”* seeks to produce faith through external control, coercion, or political power, turning belief into an obligation rather than a response of the heart. When Christianity becomes a state religion, obedience is enforced by rules, penalties, or social pressure, which may produce outward conformity but not genuine faith. In contrast, human freedom as the forerunner for true faith recognizes that faith must be a willing response to God’s grace, not something compelled by law. God designed freedom so that belief, repentance, and obedience flow from conviction rather than fear of punishment. History shows that when the Church relies on law and force, it often loses the gospel itself, but when people are free to hear, respond, and believe, true and lasting faith can take root.

## Question 7

**The Medieval Poverty Movement is a timeless reminder that political Christianity is only partial Christianity. This movement remains as a challenge to the Church (any church) that is characterized by wealth and power.**

**What does the church do with its wealth and with its power?**
Ideally, the church should use its wealth and influence to *serve*, not to control. Wealth should be directed toward caring for the poor, supporting ministry, and advancing the gospel, while power should be exercised through humble leadership, teaching, and example. History shows that when the church uses wealth to elevate itself or power to enforce conformity, it drifts away from Christ’s model of servanthood.

**In what sense is political Christianity only partial Christianity?**
Political Christianity is partial because it can shape outward behavior but cannot transform the heart. When Christianity becomes tied to the state, faith risks becoming compulsory rather than voluntary. The Medieval Poverty Movement exposed this weakness by reminding the church that the gospel is not primarily about ruling society, but about living faithfully as disciples of Christ. A church that relies on political authority may gain control, but it often loses spiritual integrity.

**Does this mean Christians should not be involved in politics or serve in government?**
No, this does not mean Christians must withdraw entirely from politics or public service. Christians can and should serve faithfully in government roles as individuals, seeking justice and the common good. The problem arises when the **church as an institution** seeks to rule the state or equates political power with spiritual authority.

**Does this mean we should not strive for “righteous” laws?**
Christians should desire laws that reflect justice, protect the vulnerable, and restrain evil. However, righteous laws cannot produce righteousness in the heart. As Jesus taught in **Mark 10:42–45**, greatness in His kingdom is defined by service, not domination. Laws may guide society, but the gospel advances through love, sacrifice, and proclamation, not coercion.

The Medieval Poverty Movement challenged the church to ask where the true church is found—not in palaces, crusades, or indulgences, but where the hungry are fed, the naked clothed, and the stranger welcomed. While some reformers went too far, their core concern exposed a real problem: clerical wealth and power often contradicted the apostolic example. The Church’s tragic choice to suppress reform through the **Inquisition**—using fear, punishment, and even torture—demonstrated the danger of confusing institutional control with faithfulness. In contrast, figures like **Francis of Assisi** showed that genuine reform comes not through force, but through humility, poverty of spirit, and obedience to Christ.

## Question 8

**Consider the examples of Wyclif and Hus. What keeps us from this kind of boldness and righteous defiance? Our rights? Our fear of what? Discuss the things for which Christians are persecuted in the West and in the rest of the world.**

When I consider the examples of **John Wyclif** and **Jan Hus**, I am struck by how little personal safety or self-preservation mattered to them compared to obedience to Christ. What often keeps us from this kind of boldness today is not lack of opportunity, but **fear**—fear of losing our comfort, reputation, careers, or social standing. We are deeply attached to our rights, security, and acceptance, and these attachments can quietly silence our witness long before physical persecution ever appears.

In the West, Christians are rarely persecuted through violence or imprisonment, but rather through **cultural pressure**, ridicule, loss of influence, and social or professional consequences for holding biblical convictions. Faith is often tolerated only as long as it remains private and non-confrontational. In contrast, Christians in many parts of the world face **imprisonment, loss of property, beatings, and even death** for openly confessing Christ. The difference is not in the call to faithfulness, but in the cost attached to it.

The examples of Wyclif and Hus remind me that boldness flows from a settled conviction that truth is worth suffering for. Their courage was rooted in Scripture and a clear conscience before God, not in political power or personal rights. The challenge for believers today—especially in the West—is to recover that same eternal perspective, valuing obedience to Christ above comfort, safety, and cultural approval, even when the cost is social rather than physical.

## **The Church at Thyatira — Revelation 2:18–29**  

### *(The Roman Catholic Church Age: AD 600–1517)*

### **Full Scripture (Revelation 2:18–29, NASB 2020)**

> *“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write:*  
> *The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like burnished bronze, says this:*  
> *‘I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first.*  
> *But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.*  
> *I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her sexual immorality.*  
> *Behold, I will throw her on a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds.*  
> *And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.*  
> *But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them—I place no other burden on you.*  
> *Nevertheless what you have, hold firmly until I come.*  
> *The one who overcomes, and the one who keeps My deeds until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;*  
> *and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to pieces, as I also have received authority from My Father;*  
> *and I will give him the morning star.*  
> *The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”*

### **Historical Context: Thyatira as the Roman Catholic Church Age (AD 600–1517)**

The church at Thyatira prophetically corresponds to the **Roman Catholic Church during the Medieval period**, beginning around **AD 600** with the rise of papal authority following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and extending through the **Reformation in 1517**. This era is marked by endurance, outward works of faith, and institutional dominance, but also by deep corruption, doctrinal compromise, and the elevation of church tradition and authority alongside—or above—Scripture.

Christ commends Thyatira for its **love, faith, service, and perseverance**, which historically aligns with genuine works of charity, missionary expansion, monastic care for the poor, and the preservation of Scripture and learning. Even within a corrupt system, God preserved a faithful remnant of believers.

### **“That Woman Jezebel” — Symbolic and Historical Meaning**

The reference to *“that woman Jezebel”* represents **corrupt religious authority** that claimed prophetic legitimacy while leading God’s people into **spiritual adultery**—a mixture of truth with idolatry and false teaching. Historically, this reflects the medieval church’s development of practices such as the veneration of saints and relics, sacramental control, indulgences, and claims of papal mediation between God and humanity. Like the Old Testament Jezebel, this system taught, seduced, and refused correction.

### **“I Gave Her Time to Repent” — Centuries of Patience**

Christ’s statement that He gave her *“time to repent”* corresponds to **centuries of divine patience**. Throughout the Middle Ages, God raised reforming voices such as the **Waldensians, Wyclif, and Hus**, along with repeated calls for moral and doctrinal reform. Instead of repentance, the institutional church often responded with suppression, persecution, and the Inquisition, demonstrating a hardened resistance to correction.

### **“A Bed of Sickness” — Historical Judgment and the Black Death**

Within the Thyatira period, the phrase *“I will throw her on a bed of sickness”* finds a striking historical correspondence in the **Black Death (AD 1347–1351)**. This catastrophic plague killed an estimated **30–50% of Europe’s population** and returned in waves for generations. While Scripture does not explicitly predict the Black Death, its timing and effects align with Christ’s warning as a **disciplinary judgment** rather than final judgment.

The plague exposed the limits of medieval sacramental theology and papal authority. Clergy died in large numbers, indulgences failed to protect, and the church proved unable to prevent or heal the devastation. Confidence in Rome eroded deeply, contributing to social upheaval, spiritual disillusionment, and an increased hunger for reform. In this sense, the Black Death functioned as a providential stripping away of false security and institutional pride.

### **“I Will Kill Her Children with Death” — Consequences of Corruption**

The *“children”* represent the doctrines, movements, and systems that flowed out of this corrupt authority. Historically, these were judged through the collapse of medieval Christendom, the exposure of theological error, and the eventual loss of universal papal control. The judgment was not merely individual but systemic.

### **The Faithful Remnant in Thyatira**

Christ carefully distinguishes a faithful remnant who *“do not hold this teaching.”* Even in the darkest centuries, God preserved true believers—within monasteries, among translators, reformers, and ordinary saints—who held fast to Christ amid corruption. They were called not to overthrow the system by force, but to **remain faithful until Christ’s return**.

### **Prophetic Significance**

Thyatira is the **longest-lasting church age**, extending from the early Middle Ages through the Reformation and overlapping into later periods. The command to *“hold fast until I come”* indicates endurance rather than immediate deliverance. The promise of authority over the nations points forward to Christ’s future reign, reminding believers that ultimate justice and restoration belong to Him alone.

### **Summary Statement**

The Church at Thyatira prophetically represents the **Roman Catholic Church Age (AD 600–1517)**—a period marked by outward works and perseverance, yet corrupted by tolerated false authority and spiritual compromise. Christ’s long patience, followed by severe disciplinary judgments such as the **Black Death**, exposed the limits of medieval Christendom and prepared the way for the Reformation. Even so, Christ preserved a faithful remnant, calling them to hold fast in hope until His return.
