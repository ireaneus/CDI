bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**The Age of the Reformation**

- The spirit of reform broke out with surprising intensity in the 16th century, giving birth to Protestantism and shattering the papal leadership of western Christendom.
- Four major traditions marked early Protestantism:
    - Lutheran
    - Reformed
    - Anabaptist
    - Anglican
- After a generation, the Church of Rome itself, led by the Jesuits, recovered its moral fervor.
- Bloody struggles between Catholics and Protestants followed, and Europe was ravaged by war before it became obvious that western Christendom was permanently divided and a few pioneers pointed toward a new way: the denominational concept.

**Different Solutions to Catholic Problems**

- One writer describes Protestantism as *“a modification of Catholicism in which Catholic problems remain, but different solutions are given.”*
- The four questions that Protestantism answered in a new way are:
    - How is a person saved?
        - Protestants say that a person is saved, not by works, but by faith alone.
    - Where does religious authority lie?
        - Protestants say that religious authority does not reside in the visible institution called the Roman church but in the Word of God found in the Bible.
    - What is the Church?
        - Protestants would say that the Church is the whole community of Christian believers, since all are priests before God.
    - What is the essence of Christian living?
        - Protestants would answer that the essence of Christian living is serving God in any useful calling, whether you are *“ordained”* or a *“layman.”*

**Leader of The Reformation?**

- Many see Martin Luther as the leader of the Reformation. However, the fuel piled up for years before Luther merely lit the spark that ignited it (see chart 48).
- His conversion came at the end of a long spiritual struggle when he read **Galatians 3:11**, where Paul quoted **Hab. 2:4** – *“The righteous man shall live by faith.”*
- Later, on October 31, 1517, he posted his 95 Theses (95 propositions for theological debate) on the Castle Church door in Wittenberg. And so, it began.
- Three and a half years later, in April 1521, Luther appeared before Emperor Charles V to defend what he had taught and written. Before he was declared a heretic, expelled from the Church and condemned to death, he was offered the opportunity to recant his writings. His response is a perfect example of submissive defiance.
- He said, *“My conscience is captive to the Word of God. Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I cannot and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen.”*
- Luther’s original intention was to reform the Catholic Church, not start a new one, but Lutheranism was the response to the Catholic Church’s rejection of this call.

**John Calvin**

- John Calvin’s leadership shaped the third reformation tradition.
- Today we call this tradition Reformed or Calvinistic Christianity.
- Luther’s central doctrine was justification by faith, and Calvin’s focus was the sovereignty of God.

**Ulrich Zwingli**

- Ulrich Zwingli led the Anabaptist movement.
- Their central focus was true discipleship and their opposition to infant baptism, insisting that baptism should be the act of obedience of one who has placed their faith in Jesus Christ.
- Anabaptist: The prefix *“ana”* means *“do-over”* – the Anabaptist taught that those who were baptized as infants needed to *“do it over”* as believing adults.
- They preferred the name Baptists to Anabaptists.
- They came out of the Reformed tradition and felt called of God to reform the reformation!
- They demonstrated that those who live most devoutly for the world to come are often in the best position to change the present.
- It is interesting how people often turn that around, declaring that some Christians are *“so heavenly minded that they are of no earthly good.”* **I am convinced that if we are truly heavenly minded, we will be and do earthly good.**
- Where Luther would allow whatever the Bible did not prohibit, Zwingli rejected whatever the Bible did not prescribe. In England, this approach was called *“puritanism.”*
- If the Lutheran reformation began in a monastic cell, the Anabaptist reformation in a prayer meeting and the Calvinistic reformation at a scholar’s desk, then the English reformation began in the affairs of state, specifically with the problem of succession to the royal throne.

**Henry VIII**

- The English or Anglican reformation was primarily a revolt against the Pope as the head of the Church.
- The Pope was unwilling to grant Henry the VIII an annulment of his marriage and approval to marry another woman.
- Protestantism had led the way for other kings and countries to avoid excommunication and *“the ban”* by establishing their own *“state church.”*
- The Anglican Church has been described as *“the most Catholic a church can be and still be protestant.”*
- Henry the VIII wanted a son as an heir to the throne and a new wife to help provide him that son.
- He changed the Church **IN** England to the Church **OF** England, establishing himself as the head of the Church and the defender of the Faith.
- Henry VIII suppressed the monasteries and published the English Bible for use in the churches.
- His son, Edward VI allowed priests to marry and replaced the old Latin service with *“Crammer’s Book of Common Prayer”* in English.
- John Foxe’s *“Book of Christian Martyrs,”* published in 1571, helped reinforce England’s break with Catholicism as he recounted the stories of the martyrs of Christianity – including the horrific persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Church during the Inquisition.
- During the reign of Elizabeth I the Anglican Church assumed its distinctive character, neither Roman nor Protestant. This certainly did not set well with the reformers returning from exile – the Puritans.

**Four Movements**

- These four movements faced different needs and emphasized different Christian solutions, all built on the same foundation with different structures of doctrine and practice. (See charts 70, 71 & 72)

**The Counter Reformation**

- Meanwhile, back in Rome, it did not take long for the Catholic Church to respond to the Reformation movement.
- Ignatius Loyola founded the Jesuits in 1534, which became both a Counter Reformation movement and a Catholic Reformation movement.
- Loyola is the author of a well-known statement: *“Pray as if everything depended on God alone; but act as though it depended on you alone whether you will be saved.”* (We usually drop that last line.)

**Religious Wars**

- From **1524-1648** there were several religious wars in various countries featuring Catholic vs. Protestant and Protestant vs. Catholic. (See chart 69)
- As the Church expands, Protestant and Catholic, it has always been in danger of identifying the Gospel with cultural norms and then insisting upon the expression of the faith in that cultural norm. Style of music would be one example of a cultural norm becoming attached to the Gospel.
- Do we establish Christianity by law or by love?
- Do we establish Christianity by force or by words and deeds?
- It is sad to say, that conquest and evangelization slowly intertwined and too few recognized the difference, whether Catholic or Protestant.
- What was it that Jesus said? **Mark 10:42-43** *“…You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you…”*
- One of the lessons learned from the 30 Years War was that the price of enforced religious conformity is excessively high.
- A lesson that should have been learned from God’s Word is that enforced religious conformity is non-Christian.
- Eventually, the goal of building a holy city that nurtures holy men was amended to, building a city where people could be holy.
- In America:
    - the waves of newcomers
    - the indifference of the second generation
    - the wide-open frontier all weighed against a religious uniformity

**The Denominational Theory**

- The Reformers had planted the seeds of the denominational theory of the Church, insisting that the identity of the true church could never be exclusively with a particular institution.
- The denominational theory looked for Christian unity in some inward religious experience and allowed diversity in the outward expressions of that personal faith.
- This tolerant attitude was not born of doctrinal indifference but was extended to those who shared a common understanding of the core doctrines of the Christian faith.
- In the end, the denominational form of the Church, though not ideal, is better than any alternative the years have offered.

**Review**

- The Reformation was remarkably swift.
- The Religious wars were certainly a black mark on the Reformation.
- The Reformation was somewhat side-tracked by holding on to the idea of a marriage between Church and State.

**In the Next Session**

- We will be discussing the four chapters in The Age of Reason and Revival.

## Key Verses

**Mark 10:42-43**

> *Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. 43But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;*

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE REFORMATION**

For the rest of this session your students will spend time discussing what they have learned and what they have written in their summary of each of the eight chapters in *“The Age of the Reformation.”*

Have your students share their insights in class.

There are a series of questions/assignments numbered and in bold letters. Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group. Either lead these discussions yourself, or assign them to individuals/groups to make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

Review the Class Assignment Schedule and remind them to read their Church History book (or History of Christian Doctrines book).

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**

*Church History in Plain Language*  
*by Bruce Shelley*

**The Age of the Reformation – 1517-1698 AD**

The spirit of reform broke out with surprising intensity in the sixteenth century, giving birth to Protestantism and shattering the papal leadership of western Christendom. Four major traditions marked early *Protestantism: Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist and Anglican*. After a generation, the Church of Rome itself, led by the Jesuits, recovered its moral fervor. Bloody struggles between Catholics and Protestants followed, and Europe was ravaged by war before it became obvious that western Christendom was permanently divided and a few pioneers pointed toward a new way: the denominational concept.

**Chapter 25 - A Wild Boar in The Vineyard – Martin Luther & Protestantism (in Germany)**

(See chart 48 for the list of Forerunners of the Reformation)

Ernst Troeltsch described Protestantism as *“a modification of Catholicism in which Catholic problems remain, but different solutions are given.”*

There are at least four questions that Protestantism answered in a new way:

1. How is a person saved? The Protestants answer: Not by works but by faith alone.
2. Where does religious authority lie? The Protestants answer: Not in the visible institution called the Roman church but in the Word of God found in the Bible.
3. What is the church? The Protestants answer: The whole community of Christian believers, since all are priests before God.
4. What is the essence of Christian living? The Protestants answer: Serving God in any useful calling, whether ordained or lay.

## Question 1

**Discuss the significance of the answers to these four questions. Would you want to expand the answers to any of these questions? Would you want to add any other questions, to clarify the differences between Catholic and Protestant? Would you eliminate any of these questions?**

*The significance of the four reform questions is that they strike at the foundation of medieval Catholicism and redefine Christianity at its core. Each question exposes a different area where authority had shifted from Scripture to church structure and tradition.*

> The question *“How is a person saved?”* is the most critical, because it addresses the basis of salvation itself. By asserting that salvation is by faith alone rather than by works or sacramental systems, Protestantism removed the Church as a necessary mediator of salvation and placed the sinner directly before God. This fundamentally changed the believer’s relationship to God and eliminated the fear-based economy of indulgences and penance.

> The question *“Where does religious authority lie?”* is significant because it challenged papal and ecclesiastical supremacy. By locating authority in Scripture alone, Protestantism introduced an objective standard that stood above councils, popes, and traditions. This shift explains why reform was possible at all, and why the Reformation produced lasting doctrinal change rather than minor institutional adjustments.

> The question *“What is the Church?”* redefined Christian identity. Instead of viewing the Church primarily as an institution ruled by clergy, Protestantism defined it as the community of believers. This restored the biblical teaching of the priesthood of all believers and emphasized spiritual unity over institutional hierarchy.

> The question *“What is the essence of Christian living?”* was significant because it rejected the sacred-secular divide. By affirming that all lawful vocations can be acts of service to God, Protestantism elevated everyday life as meaningful Christian service and removed the idea that holiness was confined to monasteries or clergy.

An additional question that could clarify the Catholic–Protestant divide is: *“What is the role of tradition in relation to Scripture?”* This would highlight the Protestant rejection of tradition as an equal authority with Scripture while still recognizing its historical value.

## Question 2

**Consider the *“Important Theological Themes for Luther”* pages 251-253 in the textbook. He was contending for these things. What are the things for which you contend? Considering other information you have learned about Luther, do you see any molehills made into mountains or any mountains made into molehills?**

The theological themes for which Luther contended are still the ones I find most worth contending for today. His emphasis on **imputed righteousness** guards the gospel from becoming a system of earned favor and keeps salvation grounded in Christ’s work rather than my own performance.

These are the same truths I would contend for: Scripture as the final authority, salvation by grace through faith alone, and a Christ-centered faith that does not avoid suffering but understands it in light of the cross.

At the same time, Luther’s life shows how even strong theological conviction can become unbalanced. His later **anti-Semitic writings** and his harsh response to the **German peasants** reveal a failure to apply gospel compassion consistently. In those areas, serious moral issues were treated as secondary concerns. In contrast, Luther at times elevated doctrinal battles and ecclesiastical authority to such a degree that pastoral care and restraint were diminished.

This tension is also seen in Luther’s later discomfort with the **Book of James**, which he referred to as an *“epistle of straw”* because of its emphasis on works. While he did not remove James from the Bible, his desire to relegate it to a lesser status reflects how strongly he reacted against anything that appeared to threaten justification by faith alone—especially later in life when he became more contentious.

Even so, Luther’s personal failures do not overshadow the significance of his stand. His refusal to violate conscience at the Diet of Worms reshaped Christianity and Western thought. Luther reminds me that God uses imperfect people to defend essential truths, and that faithfulness to the gospel must always be held together with humility and love.

## Question 3

**What are some pitfalls that come with Luther’s and Zwingli’s positions:**

Both Luther’s and Zwingli’s approaches were sincere attempts to apply Scripture faithfully, but each carried important risks

Luther’s view *allowing whatever the Bible does not expressly prohibit* protected Christian freedom, but it also allowed traditions and practices to remain in the Church that were not clearly grounded in Scripture. Over time, this could weaken the practical authority of the Bible and blur the line between biblical teaching and human tradition.

Zwingli’s approach *rejecting whatever the Bible does not expressly prescribe* took Scripture very seriously and aimed to purify the Church. However, this position could become rigid and legalistic, turning faithfulness into rule-keeping and creating division over secondary issues. In the pursuit of a pure church, grace and patience were sometimes lost.

These dangers are seen within the **Anabaptist movement**. While many Anabaptists pursued genuine discipleship, separation of Church and State, and lives shaped by love, some groups pushed these convictions too far. The attempt to establish an earthly kingdom in Münster during the 1530s shows how zeal, combined with misguided expectations about Christ’s kingdom, led to fanaticism and discredited the movement as a whole.

At the same time, the **Schleitheim Confession (1527)** reflects a healthier balance, emphasizing discipleship, love, and a voluntary church. This contrast shows me that strong conviction must always be tempered with humility, or biblical faithfulness can quickly turn into either compromise or extremism.

**Chapter 27: Thrust into the Game – John Calvin (1509-1564)**

John Calvin’s leadership in *“the game”* shaped a third reformation tradition. Today we call it Reformed or Calvinistic Christianity.

**The Meaning of Reformed Christianity**

Calvin and Luther shared the core Protestant beliefs but Calvin was 25 years younger, from a different land and had a distinctly different personality. They were impressed by different needs and emphasized different Christian solutions, built on the same foundation with different structures of doctrine & practice. Where Luther’s central doctrine was justification by faith, Calvin’s was the sovereignty of God.

Calvin built upon the work of Zwingli, seeking to bring some balance to the more radical elements of the movement. In March of 1536, Calvin published the first edition of his highly influential *Institutes of the Christian Religion.*

**Geneva: Home of Calvinism**

Christendom was still in play for Calvin. When he was offered (and he accepted) the position as Professor of Sacred Scriptures in Geneva, he prepared a confession of faith to be accepted by everyone who wished to be a citizen.

Eventually, he & William Farel were asked to leave Geneva but they returned 3 years later and the city accepted the church constitution that put many of Calvin’s leading ideas into practice.

**The Sovereignty of God**

Calvin did not profess to know absolutely who were God’s elect, but believed that three tests provided a good yardstick to judge who might be saved:

- Participation in the two sacraments of baptism & the Lord’s Supper
- An upright moral life
- A public profession of the faith

The consequence of faith to Calvin is the strenuous effort to introduce the kingdom of God on earth. His views that the church is not subject to secular government, except in obviously secular matters and the church’s obligation to guide the secular authorities in spiritual matters, led many of his followers throughout Europe in a spiritual conspiracy seeking the overthrow of false religion and restrictive governments.

**John Knox’s Scotland**

Meanwhile in England, John Knox (1514-1572) was a restless activist who had tried earlier to point England in the direction of Calvinism. He escaped the persecution led by Mary Queen of Scots (AKA *“Bloody Mary”*) and developed the theory that Protestants had the right to resist, by force if necessary, any Roman Catholic ruler who tried to prevent their worship and mission. (Further than Calvin was willing to go.)

## Question 4

**Calvin, and others, sought to establish the Kingdom of God by political means, by establishing laws and some even by the violent overthrow of existing governments. What influenced this thinking? Is it a biblical approach? Do we see this concept used in our present day? Is there a balanced approach?**

**Chapter 28 - The Curse Upon the Crown – The Church of England**

If the Lutheran reformation began in a monastic cell, the Anabaptist reformation in a prayer meeting and the Calvinistic reformation at a scholar’s desk, then the English reformation began in the affairs of state, specifically with the problem of succession to the royal throne.

England had two reformations: A constitutional one under King Henry VIII (1509-1547) and a theological one under the Puritans almost a century later.

**England’s Break with Rome**

Henry VIII – King of England – revolted against the pope because he passionately desired Anne Boleyn, to replace Catherine his wife of 18 years, who had failed to provide him with a son, which he also desired. Pope Clement VII refused to declare the marriage invalid, to allow Henry to re-marry.

In 1534, in the Act of Supremacy, Henry declared:

*“The King’s, majesty justly and rightly is and ought to be and shall be reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England called ‘Anglican Ecclesia.’”*

The establishment of the Anglican Church, the 4th Reformation Church was not primarily doctrinal, but political.

**Henry’s Dual Policy**

The sole religious issue in England’s constitutional reformation was papal supremacy. He intended no break with the old faith, for he still considered himself to be the *“Defender of the Faith.”* The two serious changes within the Church of England were the suppression of the monasteries and the publication of the English Bible for use in the churches’.

**William Tyndale’s Bible**

William Tyndale was a pioneer in the translation of the English Bible with a zeal to place the English Scripture into the hands of the common man. After 17 months in prison he was burned at the stake. His dying prayer: *“Lord, open the king of England’s eyes.”*

**The Swing to Protestantism**

When Henry’s son, Edward, took the throne there was a swing towards Protestantism. Priests could marry and the old Latin service was replaced by Crammer’s *“Book of Common Prayer”* in English.

Mary, Queen of Scots tried to lead England back to the ways of Rome. During her four-year reign, she sent nearly 300 protestants to the burning stake.

Later, John Foxe’s, *Book of Christian Martyrs* (1571), incited the English people to a longstanding horror of Catholicism. Eventually, Elizabeth’s compromise for peace tried to sound Protestant enough to satisfy the Protestants but worded in such a way that would satisfy both Catholics & Protestants. This did not set well with the returning reformers: Puritans – preachers of personal and national righteousness.

**Chapter 29 - “Another Man” At Manresa – The Catholic Reformation (See chart 68)**

Meanwhile, back at the Catholic Church, a counter-reformation was taking place. Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556) with an immense breakthrough to spiritual enlightenment in a wave of ecstatic illumination he became *“another man.”* Eventually, he founded the Jesuits, who became both a Counter Reformation movement and a Catholic Reformation movement.

## Question 5

**Read: Facets of the Counter Reformation (page 283 in textbook) discuss briefly: what was positive in this movement and what was negative.**

**Return to the Spiritual**

Even before Luther posted his thesis on the church door, there were those who sought reform within the Catholic Church but the church was slow to respond because of politics.

The initial push for reform gained traction after Emperor Charles attacked Rome (1527) and imprisoned Pope Clement VII. When Pope Paul III (1534-1549) took office, he did exactly what politically minded leaders do; he started appointing several champions of reform to the College of Cardinals. Then he appointed 9 of the new Cardinals to a Reform Commission.

After a wide-ranging study, the Reform Commission presented some solid *“advice…concerning the reform of the Church.”* This report included the revelations that: the papal office was too secular, both popes and cardinals needed to give more attention to spiritual matters and stop flirting with the world, there was bribery in high places, there was abuse of indulgence and evasions of church law and there was prostitution in Rome.

**Call for A General Council**

Pope Paul called for a General Council of the Church in Trent, Italy. The Council of Trent was delayed for 8 years by Pope Francis I – not wanting Charles V to strengthen his authority. However, some steps were taken that produced a new austerity and built new walls around Fortress Roman Catholic Church.

**Ignatius Loyola and The Society of Jesus**

Ignatius survived imprisonment and the Inquisition, and in 1540, the Pope approved the Society of Jesus – the Jesuits, as a new religious order. Their aim was simple: Restore the Roman Church to the position of spiritual power and worldly influence it had held 3 centuries earlier. *(Ah, the good old days!?)*

**The Shape of Modern Catholicism**

In 1545, the Council of Trent finally took place. Everything the Protestant Reformation stood for was vigorously and violently rejected at Trent (See chart 89). The decisions of this Council significantly shaped Roman Catholicism, even today.

Ignatius is credited with a quote many Protestants (including Evangelicals) have used, in a modified form: *“Pray as though everything depended on God alone; but act as though it depended on you alone whether you will be saved.”* We usually leave that last phrase off the quote.

**Chapter 30 - Opening the Rock – America and Asia**

In the years of discovery and global expansion (1500-1650), the Catholic and Protestant missionaries had opportunities to take their gospels to the inhabitants of these new lands. Surprisingly, to us, they struggled with the question: Should the natives be won to the *“holy faith”* by love or by force?

## Question 6

**Should the natives be won to the “holy faith” by love or by force? HOW IS THIS EVEN A QUESTION? What is the answer?**

**The Gospel and Culture**

The church is often in danger of identifying the gospel with some cultural form in which the faith has found a home. They felt constrained to insist upon the expression of the faith in only one way.

## Question 7

**Is this a danger that we also face in our culture? What cultural forms have been or currently are attached to the proper expression of faith?**

Islam’s rise cut the Christian west from the Christian east and the crusades were Christian Europe’s attempt to batter down the barriers of Islam by military force. Conquest and evangelization were slowly intertwined and few recognized a difference.

**Spaniards in The New World**

Within 50 years of the first sighting of San Salvador, the Spaniards had plundered & conquered the New World from California to the tip of South America (In Martin Luther’s lifetime). Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians or Jesuits sailed on nearly every ship – eager to convert the heathen.

**Champion of The Oppressed**

Bartholomew de Las Casas was one champion of the oppressed Indians in the New World. He met resistance and was considered a danger, a menace to New Spain. He subscribed to the philosophy of ministry that said: The only way to convert them was by peaceful preaching of the Word and by example of holy living. *(Sounds a little like the motto of Village Missions: Preach the Word & Love the People.)*

**Francis Xavier (1506-1552) and The Door to China**

Francis Xavier was praised for his missionary zeal and personal charm but was a man of his time, in that he shared the religious intolerance of his age. His years in Japan changed his views regarding Christian missions and he developed a quality of compromise in religious matters – adapting to local customs and values in every way they could.

In the East, Japan and China, the Roman Catholic missionaries often sought to compromise and adapt to local customs and values in every way they could. Too often this led to including customs, ideals and teachings that were contrary to biblical teaching. At one time, there were almost 270,000 Catholic Christians in China but the work was mostly abandoned because of disagreement as to whether the adaptations had gone too far.

**Chapter 31 - The Rule of The Saints – Puritanism**

To the Puritans, spiritual conversion was essential to Christianity. They saw themselves as the covenanted people of God and their divine mission in the world was to establish God’s Kingdom in the New World.

**Puritanism: New Life and New World**

In England the Puritans had, under Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603), tried to purify the Church of England along the lines of Calvin’s work in Geneva. Under James I and Charles I (1603-1642), they had also suffered for resisting the pressure from the monarchy to conform their worship to a *“High-Church”* style. Finally, during England’s civil war & Oliver Cromwell’s rule (1642-1660) they had a chance to shape the national church in England but failed because of their own internal dissensions.

**The People of the Book**

The Puritans were certainly influenced by John Foxe’s *“Book of Christian Martyrs.”* However, the book they were most passionate about was the Bible. They were especially passionate about the English version of the Geneva Bible. They also had a new style of preaching – a message that aimed at the heart, not at the head.

## Question 8

**Does it have to be one or the other? Can it be both?**

**Conflicts with The King**

When James I became King, the only demand he consented to with the Puritans was to have a new translation of the Scriptures made in English. Thus, the King James Bible, the Authorized Version, was produced.

Some Puritans became impatient for change in the Church of England and began to meet for worship as they felt the Bible taught them, not according to bishops and prayer books. This move, to build a separate Church in England, gained them the name Separatists. The Separatists eventually moved to Holland for safety and freedom of worship. After 10 years in Holland, they heard there was an English colony in Virginia. Out of concern for their children growing up out of touch with their homeland and forgetting their native language, the group headed for the New England on the Mayflower. Perhaps, the new American Continent would be their solution?

**Attack Upon the Lord’s Anointed**

Most Puritans saw separation from the Church of England was too drastic. They hoped for some alternative to division. However, civil war broke out (1642-1648) after Charles I tried to enforce his version of the *“divine right of kings”* and his *“High-Church”* brand of Anglican religion upon the Scots. The Parliament fought his reforms and eventually he fled, to gather his army.

The government called scores of Puritan theologians to Westminster and assigned them the task of creating a new form of worship and church government for the Church of England. The Westminster Assembly met from 1643-1649 and produced the Westminster Confession of Faith, as well as the Larger and Shorter Catechisms.

**The Rule of the Saints**

In the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell (1559-1658) became a towering figure in Christian history. He led Parliamentary armies to victory over the King’s forces and then filled the office of Lord Protector (Military Dictator). Cromwell’s rule lasted about 9 years. Just 2 years after his death, the country welcomed the return of the monarchy to England and the rule of the saints was at an end. However, tens of thousands of the saints were happily settled in New England where they were devoutly trying to erect the Kingdom of God in the American wilderness.

**Chapter 32Based  - Unwilling to Die for An Old Idea Denominations**

**Suppression of The Nonconformist**

The simple fact is Christians are divided today, in part at least, because they have the freedom to differ. In earlier centuries, they did not. Considering the Reformation, dissent was neither a Christian virtue nor a human right. Unfortunately, the Reformers were as eager as Catholics to suppress nonconformity, because both camps believed that Christian truth held societies together.

The first attempt to end religious wars, was to adopt the *“Territorial Principle”* in the Peace of Augsburg (1555). This principle simply gave the ruler in each region the power to decide the faith of his subjects, Lutheran or Catholic (Calvinism and others had not been considered).

In some situations, *“The Territorial Compromise,”* in the Royal Edict of Nantes – 1598, allowed for the setting aside of certain parts of the ruler’s territory for the Huguenots (French Calvinists) while the rest of the country remained Roman Catholic.

**The Thirty Years War (1618-1648)**

This compromise proved to be unsatisfactory. All the previous conflicts were merely a bloody prelude to the most devastating of the so-called wars of religion. (See chart 69)

What started as a religious struggle with political overtones ended as a barbarous political power struggle with religious overtones. Out of sheer futility, the religious zeal of Catholics and Calvinists cooled, and men began to question the religious-territorial idea. Eventually, denominationalism was considered as an alternative.

In the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), the way was cleared for Calvinists, Lutherans and Catholics (recognized expressions of the Christian Faith) to exist within the territories of the Princes, if the Princes chose to allow it. This was to be decided without papal interference!

**The New Way in America**

The Lesson of the 30 Years War was that the price of enforced religious conformity is too high.

Meanwhile, in America, the goal of building a holy city (State) that nurtures holy men, was amended to building a city (State) where people could be holy. The promise of religious toleration was a powerful incentive to brave the hazards of life in the American colonies.

Waves of newcomers, the indifference of the 2nd generation and the wide-open frontier all weighed against a religious uniformity.

The main exception to this general policy of religious toleration was the Congregational Puritans in Massachusetts Bay who were determined to establish a new Zion in the American wilderness: a *“due form of government both civil and ecclesiastical”* is the way Governor John Winthrop put it.

**The Idea of Denominations - Denominationalism vs. Sectarian**

The denominational theory of the Church uses the word *“denomination”* as an inclusive word. A Sect or those who are sectarian are exclusive. Denomination implies that the Christian group called or *“denominated”* by a name is but one member of a larger group, the church, to which all denominations belong.

The Reformers had planted the seeds of the denominational theory of the church when they insisted that the True Church could never be identified in any exclusive sense, with a particular institution.

The Dissenting Brethren of Westminster articulated the denominational theory of the church in several fundamental truths:

- Considering man’s inability to always see the truth clearly; differences of opinion about the outward form of the church are inevitable.
- Even though these differences do not involve fundamentals of the faith, they are not matters of indifference. Every Christian is obligated to practice what he believes the Bible teaches.
- Since no church has a final and full grasp of divine truth, the true Church of Christ can never be fully represented by any single ecclesiastical structure.
- The mere fact of separation does not of itself constitute schism. It is possible to be divided at many points and still be united in Christ.

Thus, the denominational theory of the church looked for Christian unity in some inward religious experience and allowed diversity in the outward expressions of that personal faith.

This tolerant attitude was not born of doctrinal indifference. The Independent had no intention of extending Christian unity to all professions. The identity of the *“one true church”* was restricted to those who shared a common understanding of the core of the Christian faith.

In the end, the denominational form of the church has marked the recent centuries of Christian history; not because it is ideal, but because it is better than any alternative the years have offered.

## Question 9

**A group of pastors from a variety of denominations and independent churches who prayed together regularly, described their differences as flavors of Christianity – like Baskin-Robins 31 flavors of ice cream. Is this a fair comparison? Discuss the information above regarding denominations. What are some of your agreements or disagreements with this approach? Does your Church Doctrinal Statement reflect the core beliefs of Christianity? Are there distinctive doctrines in your church doctrinal statement, that might not appear in those of other churches?**
