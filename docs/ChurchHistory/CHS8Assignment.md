bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**The Age of the Reformation**

- The spirit of reform broke out with surprising intensity in the 16th century, giving birth to Protestantism and shattering the papal leadership of western Christendom.
- Four major traditions marked early Protestantism:
    - Lutheran
    - Reformed
    - Anabaptist
    - Anglican
- After a generation, the Church of Rome itself, led by the Jesuits, recovered its moral fervor.
- Bloody struggles between Catholics and Protestants followed, and Europe was ravaged by war before it became obvious that western Christendom was permanently divided and a few pioneers pointed toward a new way: the denominational concept.

**Different Solutions to Catholic Problems**

- One writer describes Protestantism as *“a modification of Catholicism in which Catholic problems remain, but different solutions are given.”*
- The four questions that Protestantism answered in a new way are:
    - How is a person saved?
        - Protestants say that a person is saved, not by works, but by faith alone.
    - Where does religious authority lie?
        - Protestants say that religious authority does not reside in the visible institution called the Roman church but in the Word of God found in the Bible.
    - What is the Church?
        - Protestants would say that the Church is the whole community of Christian believers, since all are priests before God.
    - What is the essence of Christian living?
        - Protestants would answer that the essence of Christian living is serving God in any useful calling, whether you are *“ordained”* or a *“layman.”*

**Leader of The Reformation?**

- Many see Martin Luther as the leader of the Reformation. However, the fuel piled up for years before Luther merely lit the spark that ignited it (see chart 48).
- His conversion came at the end of a long spiritual struggle when he read **Galatians 3:11**, where Paul quoted **Hab. 2:4** – *“The righteous man shall live by faith.”*
- Later, on October 31, 1517, he posted his 95 Theses (95 propositions for theological debate) on the Castle Church door in Wittenberg. And so, it began.
- Three and a half years later, in April 1521, Luther appeared before Emperor Charles V to defend what he had taught and written. Before he was declared a heretic, expelled from the Church and condemned to death, he was offered the opportunity to recant his writings. His response is a perfect example of submissive defiance.
- He said, *“My conscience is captive to the Word of God. Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I cannot and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen.”*
- Luther’s original intention was to reform the Catholic Church, not start a new one, but Lutheranism was the response to the Catholic Church’s rejection of this call.

**John Calvin**

- John Calvin’s leadership shaped the third reformation tradition.
- Today we call this tradition Reformed or Calvinistic Christianity.
- Luther’s central doctrine was justification by faith, and Calvin’s focus was the sovereignty of God.

**Ulrich Zwingli**

- Ulrich Zwingli led the Anabaptist movement.
- Their central focus was true discipleship and their opposition to infant baptism, insisting that baptism should be the act of obedience of one who has placed their faith in Jesus Christ.
- Anabaptist: The prefix *“ana”* means *“do-over”* – the Anabaptist taught that those who were baptized as infants needed to *“do it over”* as believing adults.
- They preferred the name Baptists to Anabaptists.
- They came out of the Reformed tradition and felt called of God to reform the reformation!
- They demonstrated that those who live most devoutly for the world to come are often in the best position to change the present.
- It is interesting how people often turn that around, declaring that some Christians are *“so heavenly minded that they are of no earthly good.”* **I am convinced that if we are truly heavenly minded, we will be and do earthly good.**
- Where Luther would allow whatever the Bible did not prohibit, Zwingli rejected whatever the Bible did not prescribe. In England, this approach was called *“puritanism.”*
- If the Lutheran reformation began in a monastic cell, the Anabaptist reformation in a prayer meeting and the Calvinistic reformation at a scholar’s desk, then the English reformation began in the affairs of state, specifically with the problem of succession to the royal throne.

**Henry VIII**

- The English or Anglican reformation was primarily a revolt against the Pope as the head of the Church.
- The Pope was unwilling to grant Henry the VIII an annulment of his marriage and approval to marry another woman.
- Protestantism had led the way for other kings and countries to avoid excommunication and *“the ban”* by establishing their own *“state church.”*
- The Anglican Church has been described as *“the most Catholic a church can be and still be protestant.”*
- Henry the VIII wanted a son as an heir to the throne and a new wife to help provide him that son.
- He changed the Church **IN** England to the Church **OF** England, establishing himself as the head of the Church and the defender of the Faith.
- Henry VIII suppressed the monasteries and published the English Bible for use in the churches.
- His son, Edward VI allowed priests to marry and replaced the old Latin service with *“Crammer’s Book of Common Prayer”* in English.
- John Foxe’s *“Book of Christian Martyrs,”* published in 1571, helped reinforce England’s break with Catholicism as he recounted the stories of the martyrs of Christianity – including the horrific persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Church during the Inquisition.
- During the reign of Elizabeth I the Anglican Church assumed its distinctive character, neither Roman nor Protestant. This certainly did not set well with the reformers returning from exile – the Puritans.

**Four Movements**

- These four movements faced different needs and emphasized different Christian solutions, all built on the same foundation with different structures of doctrine and practice. (See charts 70, 71 & 72)

**The Counter Reformation**

- Meanwhile, back in Rome, it did not take long for the Catholic Church to respond to the Reformation movement.
- Ignatius Loyola founded the Jesuits in 1534, which became both a Counter Reformation movement and a Catholic Reformation movement.
- Loyola is the author of a well-known statement: *“Pray as if everything depended on God alone; but act as though it depended on you alone whether you will be saved.”* (We usually drop that last line.)

**Religious Wars**

- From **1524-1648** there were several religious wars in various countries featuring Catholic vs. Protestant and Protestant vs. Catholic. (See chart 69)
- As the Church expands, Protestant and Catholic, it has always been in danger of identifying the Gospel with cultural norms and then insisting upon the expression of the faith in that cultural norm. Style of music would be one example of a cultural norm becoming attached to the Gospel.
- Do we establish Christianity by law or by love?
- Do we establish Christianity by force or by words and deeds?
- It is sad to say, that conquest and evangelization slowly intertwined and too few recognized the difference, whether Catholic or Protestant.
- What was it that Jesus said? **Mark 10:42-43** *“…You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you…”*
- One of the lessons learned from the 30 Years War was that the price of enforced religious conformity is excessively high.
- A lesson that should have been learned from God’s Word is that enforced religious conformity is non-Christian.
- Eventually, the goal of building a holy city that nurtures holy men was amended to, building a city where people could be holy.
- In America:
    - the waves of newcomers
    - the indifference of the second generation
    - the wide-open frontier all weighed against a religious uniformity

**The Denominational Theory**

- The Reformers had planted the seeds of the denominational theory of the Church, insisting that the identity of the true church could never be exclusively with a particular institution.
- The denominational theory looked for Christian unity in some inward religious experience and allowed diversity in the outward expressions of that personal faith.
- This tolerant attitude was not born of doctrinal indifference but was extended to those who shared a common understanding of the core doctrines of the Christian faith.
- In the end, the denominational form of the Church, though not ideal, is better than any alternative the years have offered.

**Review**

- The Reformation was remarkably swift.
- The Religious wars were certainly a black mark on the Reformation.
- The Reformation was somewhat side-tracked by holding on to the idea of a marriage between Church and State.

**In the Next Session**

- We will be discussing the four chapters in The Age of Reason and Revival.

## Key Verses

**Mark 10:42-43**

> *Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. 43But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;*

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE REFORMATION**

For the rest of this session your students will spend time discussing what they have learned and what they have written in their summary of each of the eight chapters in *“The Age of the Reformation.”*

Have your students share their insights in class.

There are a series of questions/assignments numbered and in bold letters. Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group. Either lead these discussions yourself, or assign them to individuals/groups to make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

Review the Class Assignment Schedule and remind them to read their Church History book (or History of Christian Doctrines book).

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**

*Church History in Plain Language*  
*by Bruce Shelley*

**The Age of the Reformation – 1517-1698 AD**

The spirit of reform broke out with surprising intensity in the sixteenth century, giving birth to Protestantism and shattering the papal leadership of western Christendom. Four major traditions marked early *Protestantism: Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist and Anglican*. After a generation, the Church of Rome itself, led by the Jesuits, recovered its moral fervor. Bloody struggles between Catholics and Protestants followed, and Europe was ravaged by war before it became obvious that western Christendom was permanently divided and a few pioneers pointed toward a new way: the denominational concept.

**Chapter 25 - A Wild Boar in The Vineyard – Martin Luther & Protestantism (in Germany)**

(See chart 48 for the list of Forerunners of the Reformation)

Ernst Troeltsch described Protestantism as *“a modification of Catholicism in which Catholic problems remain, but different solutions are given.”*

There are at least four questions that Protestantism answered in a new way:

1. How is a person saved? The Protestants answer: Not by works but by faith alone.
2. Where does religious authority lie? The Protestants answer: Not in the visible institution called the Roman church but in the Word of God found in the Bible.
3. What is the church? The Protestants answer: The whole community of Christian believers, since all are priests before God.
4. What is the essence of Christian living? The Protestants answer: Serving God in any useful calling, whether ordained or lay.

## Question 1

**Discuss the significance of the answers to these four questions. Would you want to expand the answers to any of these questions? Would you want to add any other questions, to clarify the differences between Catholic and Protestant? Would you eliminate any of these questions?**

*The significance of the four reform questions is that they strike at the foundation of medieval Catholicism and redefine Christianity at its core. Each question exposes a different area where authority had shifted from Scripture to church structure and tradition.*

> The question *“How is a person saved?”* is the most critical, because it addresses the basis of salvation itself. By asserting that salvation is by faith alone rather than by works or sacramental systems, Protestantism removed the Church as a necessary mediator of salvation and placed the sinner directly before God. This fundamentally changed the believer’s relationship to God and eliminated the fear-based economy of indulgences and penance.

> The question *“Where does religious authority lie?”* is significant because it challenged papal and ecclesiastical supremacy. By locating authority in Scripture alone, Protestantism introduced an objective standard that stood above councils, popes, and traditions. This shift explains why reform was possible at all, and why the Reformation produced lasting doctrinal change rather than minor institutional adjustments.

> The question *“What is the Church?”* redefined Christian identity. Instead of viewing the Church primarily as an institution ruled by clergy, Protestantism defined it as the community of believers. This restored the biblical teaching of the priesthood of all believers and emphasized spiritual unity over institutional hierarchy.

> The question *“What is the essence of Christian living?”* was significant because it rejected the sacred-secular divide. By affirming that all lawful vocations can be acts of service to God, Protestantism elevated everyday life as meaningful Christian service and removed the idea that holiness was confined to monasteries or clergy.

An additional question that could clarify the Catholic–Protestant divide is: *“What is the role of tradition in relation to Scripture?”* This would highlight the Protestant rejection of tradition as an equal authority with Scripture while still recognizing its historical value.

## Question 2

**Consider the *“Important Theological Themes for Luther”* pages 251-253 in the textbook. He was contending for these things. What are the things for which you contend? Considering other information you have learned about Luther, do you see any molehills made into mountains or any mountains made into molehills?**

The theological themes for which Luther contended are still the ones I find most worth contending for today. His emphasis on **imputed righteousness** guards the gospel from becoming a system of earned favor and keeps salvation grounded in Christ’s work rather than my own performance.

These are the same truths I would contend for: Scripture as the final authority, salvation by grace through faith alone, and a Christ-centered faith that does not avoid suffering but understands it in light of the cross.

At the same time, Luther’s life shows how even strong theological conviction can become unbalanced. His later **anti-Semitic writings** and his harsh response to the **German peasants** reveal a failure to apply gospel compassion consistently. In those areas, serious moral issues were treated as secondary concerns. In contrast, Luther at times elevated doctrinal battles and ecclesiastical authority to such a degree that pastoral care and restraint were diminished.

This tension is also seen in Luther’s later discomfort with the **Book of James**, which he referred to as an *“epistle of straw”* because of its emphasis on works. While he did not remove James from the Bible, his desire to relegate it to a lesser status reflects how strongly he reacted against anything that appeared to threaten justification by faith alone—especially later in life when he became more contentious.

Even so, Luther’s personal failures do not overshadow the significance of his stand. His refusal to violate conscience at the Diet of Worms reshaped Christianity and Western thought. Luther reminds me that God uses imperfect people to defend essential truths, and that faithfulness to the gospel must always be held together with humility and love.

## Question 3

**What are some pitfalls that come with Luther’s and Zwingli’s positions:**

Both Luther’s and Zwingli’s approaches were sincere attempts to apply Scripture faithfully, but each carried important risks

Luther’s view *allowing whatever the Bible does not expressly prohibit* protected Christian freedom, but it also allowed traditions and practices to remain in the Church that were not clearly grounded in Scripture. Over time, this could weaken the practical authority of the Bible and blur the line between biblical teaching and human tradition.

Zwingli’s approach *rejecting whatever the Bible does not expressly prescribe* took Scripture very seriously and aimed to purify the Church. However, this position could become rigid and legalistic, turning faithfulness into rule-keeping and creating division over secondary issues. In the pursuit of a pure church, grace and patience were sometimes lost.

These dangers are seen within the **Anabaptist movement**. While many Anabaptists pursued genuine discipleship, separation of Church and State, and lives shaped by love, some groups pushed these convictions too far. The attempt to establish an earthly kingdom in Münster during the 1530s shows how zeal, combined with misguided expectations about Christ’s kingdom, led to fanaticism and discredited the movement as a whole.

At the same time, the **Schleitheim Confession (1527)** reflects a healthier balance, emphasizing discipleship, love, and a voluntary church. This contrast shows me that strong conviction must always be tempered with humility, or biblical faithfulness can quickly turn into either compromise or extremism.

## Question 4

**Calvin, and others, sought to establish the Kingdom of God by political means, by establishing laws and some even by the violent overthrow of existing governments. What influenced this thinking? Is it a biblical approach? Do we see this concept used in our present day? Is there a balanced approach?**

Calvin’s desire to establish the Kingdom of God through laws and civic reform was shaped by both theology and historical context. Living in a time when Church and State were closely intertwined, Calvin and others assumed that a godly society required godly rulers and laws. His strong emphasis on the **sovereignty of God** led to the conviction that all areas of life—including government—fell under God’s authority. If rulers opposed true worship, some concluded that resistance was justified in order to protect the gospel.

This thinking was also influenced by Scripture. Passages such as **Acts 4:19–20**, where Peter declares, *“We must speak of what we have seen and heard,”* showed that obedience to God takes precedence over obedience to men when the two conflict. In addition, the Old Testament examples of God appointing rulers (**Daniel 2:21**) and the anointing of kings such as Saul and David reinforced the belief that God actively works through political authority. If God establishes rulers, some reasoned that God’s kingdom could—and should—be advanced through them.

However, the Bible also teaches submission to governing authorities (**Romans 13:1–7**) and respect for those God has placed in power, even when they are flawed. David’s refusal to harm Saul, *“the Lord’s anointed”* (**1 Samuel 24:6**), demonstrates restraint and trust in God’s timing rather than political force. These passages suggest that while believers must obey God above all, they are not called to establish God’s kingdom through coercion or violence.

This tension shows that establishing the Kingdom of God by political force is not a fully biblical approach. Jesus clearly taught that His kingdom is *“not of this world”* (**John 18:36**) and modeled influence through teaching, sacrifice, and servanthood rather than domination. When Christians attempt to usher in the kingdom through power or force, the gospel is often distorted.

We still see this concept today when Christians equate political success with spiritual faithfulness, or believe that passing laws or controlling institutions will produce righteousness. While political engagement is not wrong, confusing political power with kingdom advancement repeats the same imbalance seen in Calvin’s era.

A balanced approach recognizes that God is sovereign over governments, calls believers to submit to authority, and also calls them to obey God when obedience is costly. Being *heavenly minded* does not mean withdrawal from society, but it does mean refusing to confuse earthly power with spiritual transformation. As the Anabaptists demonstrated, lives shaped by faithful discipleship often have the greatest impact on the present without relying on political control.

In the end, the Kingdom of God advances most clearly through transformed lives, faithful witness, and obedience to Christ—not through force, law, or political dominance.

## Question 5

**Read: Facets of the Counter Reformation (page 283 in textbook) discuss briefly: what was positive in this movement and what was negative.**

The Counter Reformation included both genuine spiritual renewal and firm institutional resistance to change. On the positive side, it addressed real moral and spiritual problems within the Catholic Church. Reform-minded leaders recognized corruption in the papacy, the worldliness of church leadership, the abuse of indulgences, and widespread moral failure. The Reform Commission appointed under Pope Paul III acknowledged these issues openly and called for a return to spiritual seriousness. Figures such as Ignatius Loyola embodied this renewed devotion, emphasizing discipline, prayer, education, and missionary effort through the Jesuits. In this sense, the Counter Reformation produced sincere reform and strengthened Catholic spirituality.

However, the movement also had clear negative aspects. Political interests delayed meaningful reform, as seen in the long postponement of the Council of Trent. When Trent finally convened, it rejected every core teaching of the Protestant Reformation and chose consolidation over correction. Instead of allowing Scripture to challenge tradition, the Church reinforced its authority, built institutional defenses, and closed itself off from reforming dialogue. This hardened division between Catholics and Protestants and ensured that reconciliation was no longer possible.

## Question 6

**Should the natives be won to the “holy faith” by love or by force? HOW IS THIS EVEN A QUESTION? What is the answer?**

**The Gospel and Culture**

The natives should be won to the “holy faith” by love, not force. While it may seem shocking that this was even a question, Scripture shows that the early Church itself had to work through how the gospel crosses cultural boundaries without being imposed by power.

The apostles faced this issue directly when Gentiles began coming to faith. In Acts 10, Peter learned through God’s vision that Gentiles were no longer to be considered unclean. Yet even after this revelation, Peter struggled with cultural pressure and withdrew from eating with Gentile believers when Jewish Christians were present (Galatians 2:11–14). This shows that cultural habits can persist even after theological truth is understood.

The issue was addressed formally in Acts 15 at the Jerusalem Council. The apostles agreed that Gentiles were not required to adopt Jewish law or culture in order to be saved. However, they asked Gentile believers to abstain from certain practices—such as food sacrificed to idols and blood—not as a condition of salvation, but to preserve unity and avoid unnecessary offense. This decision demonstrates a biblical balance: the gospel was not compromised, but cultural sensitivity was practiced in love.

Paul later clarified this principle in 1 Corinthians 8–10, teaching that while idols have no real power, believers should limit their freedom when exercising it would harm another person’s conscience. The gospel was therefore never spread by force, nor was culture imposed as law. Instead, faith was invited through truth, patience, and love.

This apostolic model exposes the error of missionary efforts that confused the gospel with European culture or political dominance. True conversion cannot be produced by coercion. Christianity transcends culture and must be communicated in ways that respect conscience while remaining faithful to Christ.

In short, the answer is clear: the gospel advances through love and witness, not force, and the early Church itself provides the pattern for cultural adaptability without compromise.

## Question 7

**Is this a danger that we also face in our culture? What cultural forms have been or currently are attached to the proper expression of faith?**

Yes, this is still a danger we face today. History shows that the gospel is easily distorted when it becomes tied to cultural, political, or military power. During the Crusades and the Spanish conquest of the New World, evangelization was often intertwined with force and domination, making conversion appear as submission to a culture rather than faith in Christ. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier illustrate the opposite danger, where adapting too closely to local customs led to the inclusion of unbiblical beliefs and practices, weakening the clarity of the gospel. Bartholomew de Las Casas provides a corrective example by insisting that conversion must come through peaceful preaching and holy living rather than coercion. These same risks remain today when Christianity is identified with nationalism, politics, worship style, or social status. The gospel must neither be enforced by power nor reshaped by culture, but faithfully proclaimed in love while remaining distinct from every cultural form.

## Question 8

**Does it have to be one or the other? Can it be both?**

It does not have to be one or the other—it can be both. The Puritans were known for preaching that aimed at the heart, not just the head, but that does not mean doctrine and emotion are opposed. True biblical faith involves both understanding truth and being personally transformed by it. The Westminster Confession and Catechisms show that the Puritans cared deeply about sound theology, while their preaching and emphasis on conversion show they also wanted inward change.

This chapter shows that faith must engage both mind and heart, and reform must combine biblical conviction with humility. When either is missing—whether emotional zeal without grounding or rigid structure without spiritual life—the Church becomes unbalanced.

## Question 9

**A group of pastors from a variety of denominations and independent churches who prayed together regularly, described their differences as flavors of Christianity – like Baskin-Robins 31 flavors of ice cream. Is this a fair comparison? Discuss the information above regarding denominations. What are some of your agreements or disagreements with this approach? Does your Church Doctrinal Statement reflect the core beliefs of Christianity? Are there distinctive doctrines in your church doctrinal statement, that might not appear in those of other churches?**

The comparison of denominations to “31 flavors” of ice cream captures part of the truth but oversimplifies the issue. It is helpful in the sense that denominations can reflect different emphases, worship styles, and church structures while still sharing core Christian beliefs. The denominational theory developed after the religious wars recognized that no single church has a complete grasp of divine truth and that unity can exist around essential doctrines even when secondary matters differ.

However, the comparison can also be misleading. Ice cream flavors are merely preferences, while doctrinal differences are not trivial. Some differences are significant and affect how churches understand Scripture, salvation, and authority. Denominational diversity should not mean doctrinal indifference.

I agree that unity should be based on shared core beliefs—such as the authority of Scripture, the deity of Christ, and salvation by grace through faith. At the same time, churches may hold distinctive doctrines that shape their identity and practice. My church’s doctrinal statement reflects these core Christian truths while also including certain distinctive positions that may not appear in every other church.

## **The Church of Sardis and the Reformation Era (1517–1648)**

The Church of Sardis prophetically corresponds well to the Reformation period, especially as it culminates in **1648 with the Peace of Westphalia**. The Reformation restored vital doctrines such as justification by faith and the authority of Scripture, giving Protestant Christianity a renewed “name” of life after centuries of medieval corruption. However, as the movement progressed, many Reformed churches became state-controlled, institutional, and spiritually formal rather than spiritually vibrant. By the end of the Thirty Years’ War in 1648, Protestantism had achieved political recognition but often lacked widespread spiritual renewal.

Like Sardis, the Reformation church had a reputation for being alive—having recovered biblical truth—yet it struggled with incomplete reform and entanglement with political power. Still, there remained a faithful remnant, seen in movements such as the Puritans and later Pietists, who sought genuine spiritual awakening and personal holiness. Thus, Sardis fittingly reflects a church that had doctrinal recovery but required revival.

## **Revelation 3:1–6 (NASB1995)**

> **1** “To the angel of the church in Sardis write:  
> He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: ‘I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.  
> **2** Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God.  
> **3** So remember what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent. Therefore if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.  
> **4** But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.  
> **5** He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.  
> **6** He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”
