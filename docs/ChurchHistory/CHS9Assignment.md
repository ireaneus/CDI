bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

**The Age of Reason and Revival**

- The Age of Reformation was marked by debate among Christians about the way of salvation.
- The Age of Reason and Revival was highlighted by the denial of any supernatural religion.
- Respect for science and human reason replaced the Christian faith as the cornerstone of Western culture. Many Protestants met this crisis of faith, not by arguments, but by the experience of supernatural conversion. Faith was less dogma and more experience.
- This evangelical Christianity spread rapidly by the power of preaching alone.

**Religious Freedom**

- Many Christians came to see that state support was no longer essential for Christianity’s survival.
- Modern Christians could accept religious freedom.

**The Age of Reason**

- The Age of Reason was the birth of secularism.
- *Secularism is a social and political philosophy that seeks to separate the Church from the State. In fact, it rejects any influence of religion, faith and worship. Ultimately it seeks to destroy all influence of Christianity.*
- This is the foundation for the idea that anything except religion, especially Christianity, is tolerated, promoted and glorified.
- Religion, however, must be banned from the public square.
- Some showed high regard for the religion of Jesus but had profound contempt for Christianity’s social failures.
- Questions of dogma seemed unimportant, hardly worth fretting about.
- What was immensely more important was behavior.
- Even the age of the Reformation had proved again that faith and power are a potent brew. If Christians had access to power, they used it to compel conformity to their version of the truth: Catholic, Lutheran or Reformed.

**Difference Between the Renaissance and Reformation**

- The Enlightenment or Renaissance – was seen as a rebirth.
- This was a philosophical movement, characterized by belief in the power of human reason and by innovations in political, religious, and educational doctrine.
- The seeds of this movement probably lie in the Reformation era itself.
- It involved the rebirth or recovery of the values of classical Greek and Roman civilization expressed in literature, politics and the arts.
- Many of the Reformers, Luther in particular, had cautioned against traveling down this path because it could lead to the imbalance of a humanistic focus.
- The differences in the Reformation and the Renaissance lie in their view of man:
    - The Reformers preached of the original sin of man and looked upon the world as “fallen” from God’s intended place.
    - The Renaissance had a positive estimate of human nature and the universe itself; that they are basically good.
- The English Civil War, the persecution of the French Huguenots and the Thirty Years War in Germany caused people to cry out against the power of fanatical clerics.
- Religious prejudice seemed like a far greater danger than atheism.
- There was also a new faith in law and order – particularly in modern science.
- It is ironic, that most of those early scientists were men of faith who believed that the God of the Bible was the God of creation.

**The Church’s Failure**

- The Church’s mishandling of Scripture and over reaction to what they perceived as danger and heresy caused the Church to abandon one of the more powerful evidences of the existence and nature of God – *His glory declared by all of creation*.
- In this era, Christianity was certainly on trial.
- The most powerful charges leveled against the Church were the thousands upon thousands of victims of Christianity’s intolerance.
- Christianity’s critics measured Christian behavior by standards that were actually the legacy of Christian teaching.
- These attacks upon Christian convictions demanded that the Church respond with:
    - a humble confession of wrong
    - genuine repentance
    - a vigorous and well-reasoned response from orthodox Christians – proclaiming the truth.
- The response was woefully inadequate.
- The first response was to appeal to secular authorities to censor the dangerous books, without regard to the primary issues the scoffers raised.
- One writer that did respond reasonably, with a great impact upon the debate, was Bishop Joseph Butler of England, who wrote his monumental work *“The Analogy of Religion.”*
- Butler was able to settle the fundamental issues with this book, though skirmishes continue to this day.
- *Deism, the belief in a God who created the world but has since remained indifferent to it*, ultimately collapsed from its own weaknesses; but the negative work of the Age of Reason endured.
- Men made a deliberate attempt to organize a religiously neutral civilization, where faith had to be confined to the home and the heart.

**The Thirst of the Soul**

- Even in the Age of Reason, the thirst of the soul could not be ignored.
- An important new movement called Pietism arose as a reminder of that fact.
- Three men Philip Jacob Spener, August Hermann Francke and Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf highlight the history of Pietism.
- Any religion that becomes the religion of the majority and slowly turns into a social habit tends to grow humdrum and flat, regardless of its original glow of enthusiasm.
- The Christian life, in German Lutheranism, was less a personal relation to Christ and more a matter of membership in the state church.
- *Pietism arose as a response with a twofold aim:*
    - First, was the importance of personal faith – a personal experience of God’s grace in the believer’s heart.
    - Second, was to shift the center of the Christian life from the state churches, to intimate fellowships of those with a living faith in God.
- Pietism made an enormous contribution to Christianity worldwide.
- Pietists were those who brought a disciplined and emotional devotion in their practice of Christianity:
    - They shifted the emphasis from avid controversy to the care of souls.
    - They established preaching and pastoral visitation as central concerns of the Protestant ministry.
    - They enriched Christian music, bringing an experiential and personal flavor to their hymns.
    - Their dominate theme of regeneration made Pietism the fountain of all modern revivals.
- As Evangelicals, we inherited two important traits from Pietism:
    - Emotion as the major response to the mysteries of faith, sometimes to the endangerment of reason and
    - The shift from the traditional state churches to intimate fellowship groups or voluntary associations of believers.
- The evangelical movement saw three geographic regions significantly changed:
    - Germany by the rise of Pietism,
    - The British Isles by the preaching of the Methodists, and
    - The American Colonies by the impact of the Great Awakening.

**The Great Awakening**

- We could find most of the basic beliefs of the evangelicals in *Puritanism*.
- The Puritans were a group of Protestants that arose in the 16th century within the Church of England. They demanded the simplification of the doctrine and worship. They also called for greater strictness in religious discipline.
- During part of the 17th century, the Puritans became a powerful political party. They were more concerned with politics, trying to create the holy commonwealth, the true Bible society first in England and then in America.
- Their attempt to legislate Christianity is one of the reasons that Americans tended to hate, or at least have a low opinion of, the Puritans.
- The evangelicals were not detached from politics, as the Pietists were, but their controlling passion was the conversion of the lost.
- No event marked the new order for Christianity more clearly than the religious explosion, we call the Great Awakening, the first in the long history of American Revivals.

**Whitefield and Wesley**

- George Whitefield and John Wesley were instrumental in spreading revival and turning many to Christ in America and England, as they preached in churches, jails, inns, on ships and in the open air.
- John had a gift for administration and established the Methodist structure of Societies divided into smaller groups of twelve members, called classes, to share testimonies, prayer and spiritual encouragement.
- It is interesting to note that God greatly blessed and used both these men though George Whitefield was a strong supporter of Calvinism and John Wesley was staunchly Arminian in his theology.
- What do you think that tells us? This would be a good question to discuss later.

**Isaac Backus**

- As an advocate of religious freedom, Isaac Backus played a significant role in American history.
- He helped formulate and publicize the evangelical position of church and state that was ultimately to prevail throughout America.
- His fundamental assumption was that “God has appointed two different kinds of government in the world which are different in their nature and ought never to be confounded; one is civil the other ecclesiastical.”
- Backus said, “Religion is a voluntary obedience unto God which force cannot promote.”
- Thomas Jefferson agreed, “Coercion of opinion by the state in the interest of uniformity, has served only to make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites”

**The Kingdom of God in America**

- The Kingdom of God would come to America if a majority of the citizens could be persuaded to submit voluntarily to the laws of God.
- Revivals were God’s means to that end.
- The American view of church and state is rooted in the conception of the Church as a spiritual body existing for spiritual purposes and moving along spiritual paths.
- It never occurred to the average American that there is any reason why state churches should exist.
- Compulsion of any kind is contrary to the nature of such a body. It desires no state help. It does not seek for exclusive privileges. Nothing in the new order of the ages was newer than that!

**Review**

- The Church faced a new challenge because of the loss of “political power.” However, the power of the gospel to change lives came to the forefront in times of revival.
- The pursuit of our own hearts and ways never satisfy the soul. This is important for us to remember.
- Proclaim the gospel – speak the truth of God’s Word. Not just with our voice but especially with our lives and our character.

**In the Next Session**

- Next time we will be discussing the chapters in The Age of Progress.

## Key Verses

**Ezekiel 18:2**

> 2 *“What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,*  
> *‘The fathers eat the sour grapes,*  
> *But the children’s teeth are set on edge’?*  
> 3 *As I live,” declares the Lord God, “you are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore.*  
> 4 *Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.*

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES: THE AGE OF REASON**

For the rest of this session spend time discussing what your students have learned and written in their summary of each of the four chapters in “The Age of Reason and Revival.”

There are a series of questions or assignments numbered and in bold letters.

Because of time constraints, use your discretion regarding which of these you would like to have your students work on and discuss as a group. You can lead these discussions yourself or assign some of them to individuals or groups and have them make a presentation or lead the discussion. One suggestion would be to have at least one student (or more, depending on your situation) share their summary as you cover each of the chapters in the notes below.

**Chapter (Section) Summaries and Notes for Discussion**  
Church History in Plain Language  
by Bruce Shelley

**The Age of Reason and Revival – 1648-1789 AD**  
The Age of Reformation was marked by debate among Christians about the way of salvation. The Age of Reason was highlighted by the denial of any supernatural religion. Respect for science and human reason replaced the Christian faith as the cornerstone of Western culture. Many Protestants met this crisis of faith, not by arguments, but by the experience of supernatural conversion. Faith was less dogma and more experience. This evangelical Christianity spread rapidly by the power of preaching alone. In addition, many Christians came to see that state support was no longer essential for Christianity’s survival. Modern Christians could accept religious freedom.

## Question 1

**There is a need for balance. Is Christianity rational and reasonable? Is there mystery and emotion in Christianity? Are they mutually exclusive?**

I believe Christianity is both rational and full of mystery—and those two are not enemies. In fact, they need each other.

Christianity is rational in the sense that it is grounded in truth, history, and logical coherence. The faith is not blind belief. The resurrection, the reliability of Scripture, fulfilled prophecy, and the moral consistency of biblical teaching all invite examination. Even Scripture itself encourages reasoned thinking **(Isaiah 1:18; Acts 17:2)**. Christianity does not ask us to turn off our minds.

However, Christianity also contains mystery. The Trinity, the incarnation of Christ, divine sovereignty and human responsibility—these are truths we can understand in part, but never exhaust fully. If God is infinite and we are finite, it makes sense that there would be aspects of Him beyond complete comprehension. Mystery does not mean irrational—it means greater than our full grasp.

There is also emotion in Christianity, and rightly so. Salvation is not just a concept—it is a transformation of the heart. Repentance involves sorrow over sin. Worship involves joy, gratitude, awe, and love. The Great Awakening showed that when the gospel grips people deeply, it moves both mind and heart. Emotion becomes unhealthy only when it is detached from truth.

The Enlightenment tried to strip away mystery and emotion in favor of pure reason. But that produced a faith that was cold and reduced mostly to ethics. On the other hand, emotionalism without truth can become unstable and manipulative. Balance means that reason guards truth, mystery humbles us, and emotion reflects genuine response.

So no—they are not mutually exclusive. Christianity is reasonable, but not limited to reason. It includes mystery, but not irrationality. It stirs emotion, but not chaos. A healthy faith engages the whole person—mind, heart, and will.

That balance seems to be exactly what was missing during the Age of Reason—and it is something the Church still needs today.

## Question 2

**Consider Mt 5:13-16. I believe that the Church is often rejected, not because of our failures, but because we refuse to humble ourselves, acknowledge our failures and repent. What keeps us from doing this? Consider Josh 7:19.**

When I read Matthew 5:13–16, Jesus says we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world. Salt preserves and influences. Light exposes darkness and gives direction. But Jesus also warns that salt can lose its usefulness and light can be hidden. That makes me think the issue is not just whether we fail—we all do—but whether we remain transparent and repentant when we fail.

I believe one of the main things that keeps the Church from humbling itself is *pride*. We fear losing credibility, authority, or influence. We may think admitting wrong will weaken our witness, when in reality it strengthens it. Instead of confession, we sometimes protect our image. That image-preservation instinct can harden into defensiveness.

**Joshua 7:19** gives a powerful example. After Israel’s defeat at Ai because of Achan’s hidden sin, Joshua says:

> “My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.”

Giving glory to God in that moment meant confessing sin. Hiding sin did not protect Israel—it brought defeat. Confession restored clarity and allowed the people to move forward.

In the same way, what keeps us from repentance today is often:

- Pride – wanting to protect our reputation.
- Fear – worrying about what others will think.
- Love of power or influence – fearing loss of control.
- Institutional preservation – valuing stability over integrity.

The Church is not rejected simply because it fails; it is rejected when it refuses to act like people who believe in grace. True salt preserves by remaining pure. True light shines by being exposed, not hidden, repentance is not weakness—it is obedience and glory to God.

**Chapter 34 - The Heart and its Reasons Pascal and The Pietists**

Even in the Age of Reason the thirst of the soul could not be ignored. An important new movement called Pietism arose as a reminder of that fact. Pietists included some Roman Catholics, but included those from all the Reformation churches.

**Appeals to “Cheap Grace”**

As confessors, the Jesuits were lenient, very lenient regarding what was mortal sin, venial sin or no sin at all. They were skilled in the art of *Casuistry.* (CASUISTRY - kash’oo is tree - *Subtle but misleading or false reasoning; often specifically about moral issues.*)

## Question 3

**Review: “Mental Reservation and Probabilism.” Provide examples.**

**Mental Reservation** was the idea that a person could say something that sounded true outwardly, while privately meaning something different in their mind. This allowed them to avoid technically “lying,” even though they were being deceptive.

**Example:**
If someone asked, “Did you take the money?” a person might answer, “I did not take the money,” while silently adding in their mind, “today.” Technically they believed they were not lying, but practically they were misleading the listener.

This approach weakened the seriousness of truthfulness because it focused more on wording than on honesty.

**Probabilism** taught that if a respected theologian had argued that a certain action was permissible—even if another stronger argument said it was wrong—a person could choose the easier opinion and still feel justified.

**Example:**
If most theologians said charging high interest was wrong, but one respected authority argued it could be acceptable in certain cases, a person could follow that more lenient opinion and feel morally safe—even if it seemed less convincing.

This often allowed people to choose the easier path rather than the stricter or more biblically serious one.

### Why This Matters

Both ideas made it easier to excuse sin instead of confronting it. Rather than leading to repentance, they provided technical loopholes. That is why critics like Pascal opposed them—because they encouraged “cheap grace” instead of genuine transformation.

The larger lesson is that clever reasoning should never replace honesty, repentance, and a sincere pursuit of holiness.

## Question 4

**Review and discuss “Protestant Scholasticism.” What does this tell us about how we should approach Scripture?**

**Protestant Scholasticism** developed after the Reformation as Protestant theologians began systematizing doctrine in very detailed, technical ways. They used precise categories, philosophical language, and complex argument structures to defend Protestant beliefs against Catholic critics.

While this strengthened doctrinal clarity, it also had weaknesses. In many cases, theology became highly academic and intellectual. Faith risked becoming an exercise in debate rather than a living relationship with Christ.

### Example

Instead of preaching Scripture devotionally and practically (as Luther often did), some later theologians focused heavily on defining fine points of doctrine—such as intricate arguments about predestination or the logical order of salvation—sometimes with little emphasis on personal repentance or spiritual growth.

Another example would be ministers trained primarily to win theological arguments rather than shepherd souls. Doctrine became something to master intellectually rather than something that transformed the heart.

### What This Teaches Us About Scripture

Protestant Scholasticism reminds us that:

- Scripture must be studied carefully and seriously.
- Doctrine matters and should be clearly defined.
- But theology must never become detached from spiritual life.

We should approach Scripture with both **reverence and humility**. It is not merely a text to analyze but the living Word of God meant to transform us. Sound doctrine and heartfelt devotion must remain connected.

If we treat Scripture only as an academic system, we risk spiritual dryness. If we ignore careful study, we risk error. **The balance is to study deeply, believe sincerely, and obey faithfully.**

**5. Discuss the influence of Pietism on the Church today. Are their practices and ideas that we, perhaps take for granted in our churches?**

Here is a clear, classroom-ready response written in a thoughtful but simple tone:

---

## Question 5

**Discuss the influence of Pietism on the Church today. Are there practices and ideas we perhaps take for granted in our churches?**

One of Pietism’s most visible contributions is the practice of **small group gatherings**. Home Bible studies, prayer groups, and fellowship meetings outside of the main worship service reflect the Pietist model. Philip Spener’s “collegia pietatis” (gatherings of the pious) laid the foundation for what we now consider normal church life—small, relational settings focused on Scripture and spiritual growth.

Pietism also influenced the Church’s emphasis on **personal conversion and assurance of salvation**. The expectation that a believer should be able to testify to a genuine relationship with Christ is a deeply Pietist concept. Today, sharing personal testimonies is common in evangelical churches, but that was not always the case historically.

Additionally, Pietists were active in **ministries to the disadvantaged**—founding orphanages, schools, hospitals, and outreach programs. Many churches today assume that caring for the poor and engaging in missions is a natural part of Christian life. That strong connection between faith and compassionate action was greatly strengthened by Pietist influence.

However, Pietism also teaches us a caution. While it rightly emphasized heartfelt devotion, there is always a risk that emotion can overshadow doctrinal depth. The lesson for today is balance—personal faith and strong doctrine must remain united.

In summary, many practices we consider normal—small groups, testimony sharing, discipleship emphasis, social ministries, and missions—owe much to Pietism. What began as a corrective to spiritual dryness became a shaping force in modern evangelical Christianity.

## **6. What are the implications of the fact that God used both Whitefield and Wesley and blessed their ministries greatly – though they held firmly opposing doctrines? What does their example of friendship and ministry tell us?**

Here are some suggestions: That God’s blessing is not tied directly or exclusively to either of these two doctrinal positions. (?) That God’s blessing is tied to the Gospel. That we can and should work together with others, if we hold to the core doctrines of Christianity. That it is okay for us to have opposing doctrinal views if we share the core doctrines. That God is gracious!

**The Methodist Structure**

Whitefield had no real taste for organization, but Wesley was an administrative genius. John, and his brother Charles, founded Methodist societies which became the center of Christian experience for those who attended.

Societies were divided into smaller groups of 12 or so members called classes, where they would confess their sins to one another, submit to the discipline of their leader, share testimonies and join in prayer and song. They would also donate a penny a week for financial support of the ministry.

The Methodists became a church within the Anglican Church until the establishment of the Methodist Church in America in Baltimore, Maryland in 1784. The Methodists became a separate church in England after Wesley’s death in 1791.

**Chapter 36 - A New Order of the Ages – The Great Awakening – 1725-1760**

No event marked the new order for Christianity more clearly than the religious explosion, we call the Great Awakening, the first in the long history of American Revivals. What was the Great Awakening and why was it crucial to the development of Christianity in America?

**New Order for the Churches**

In the American colonies, the Christian churches were unanimous on one thing, each wanted the complete freedom to proclaim its own view. It became obvious that the only way each group could get such freedom for themselves was to grant it to all the others.

“Voluntarism” was the name given to this idea, because the churches were deprived of state support and were compelled to maintain their mission of preaching and teaching on a voluntary basis. The Great Awakening proved it could work.
**God’s Will in Society**

The Puritans in Massachusetts aimed to knit together the whole community according to God’s design – through their civil covenant. Their experiment blended belief in a church of the truly converted with the idea of a Christian state. God’s will was embodied in “wholesome laws,” drawn from Scripture and that which advances the public good. It seemed destined to fail almost from the start. (Wheat and tares? Mt 13:24-30, 36-43)

As the zeal of the founders faded over the years, fewer men and women could boldly testify of experienced grace. To keep membership from shrinking drastically, many churches in 1662 had to settle for the “Half-Way Covenant.” The “unawaken” could enjoy partial membership – for political and social purposes; at least until church membership was no longer required to be able to vote. (Was it a Calvinism that was out of balance with itself that had left people without hope of assurance?)

The Great Awakening knew both the frown and the smile of God. It restored both the tears of repentance to colonial Christianity and the joy of salvation. For twenty years (1720-1740) the awakening appeared as a series of regional breezes. These breezes moved through the ministry of preachers in many different churches and many different denominations. In December 1734 – Northampton, Massachusetts – Jonathan Edwards records, that “the Spirit of God began extraordinarily to set in. There was a great and earnest concern about the great things of the eternal world that swept the town. The work of conversion was carried on in a most astonishing manner; souls did, as it were, come by flocks to Jesus Christ.”

Believe it or not, there were those who opposed the revival!

**The Great Revivalist**

George Whitefield added his voice with other faithful preachers throughout all New England. Whitefield left New England after a month, but the regional awakenings were no longer refreshing breezes. They had churned up a spiritual hurricane called the Great Awakening. The faithful proclamation of God’s Word brought results as God’s Spirit brought light and life to multitudes, as well as great changes to churches, families and communities.

**Advocate of Religious Freedom**

Isaac Backus eventually joined the ranks of faithful preachers in the Great Awakening. He, with a handful of others, formed the 1st Baptist Church of Middleborough, Massachusetts. He played a significant role in American history as an advocate for religious freedom; formulating and publicizing the evangelical position of church and state that was ultimately to prevail throughout America.

His fundamental assumption was that “God has appointed two different kinds of government in the world which are different in their nature and ought never to be confounded”; one is civil the other ecclesiastical. “Religion is a voluntary obedience unto God which force cannot promote.” The kingdom of God would come to America if a majority of the citizens could be persuaded to submit voluntarily to the laws of God. Revivals were God’s means to that end. Whosoever will, may come and whosoever won’t may not.

The depth of the Awakening’s break with the past lies in the revivalists’ message. Concentrating on the individual’s need for salvation, they tended to neglect the political and social implications of the gospel. The perspective shifted from a “holy commonwealth” to the American people’s struggle for “liberty.”

The American view of church and state is rooted in the conception of the Church as a spiritual body, existing for spiritual purposes and moving along spiritual paths. It never occurred to the average American that there is any reason why state churches should exist. Compulsion of any kind is contrary to the nature of such a body. It desires no state help. It does not seek for exclusive privileges. Nothing in the new order of the ages was newer than that!

**7. “A spiritual body, existing for spiritual purposes and moving along spiritual paths.” Does this idea preclude or exclude practical involvement in the culture or society? Does this concept exclude churches from proclaiming God’s Word outside of churches?**
