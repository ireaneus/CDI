title: Church History Session 2 - Pictures of the Church
date: 33 - 2000 A.D.
instructor: Russell Richardson
course: Church History
description: Know some of the word pictures used in the New Testament to describe the church. Be able to explain the significance of those pictures.
bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.32-36)*

You will KNOW:

- New Testament word pictures tell us much about our Savior and about ourselves.

You will BE ABLE TO:

- Understand that things that are true about the individual disciple are generally true about the Church.

**In the Last Session**

- The *“Ekklesia”* are citizens who are called together to deal with the business of the kingdom and is used to describe those called together by Christ to take care of His business.
- The *“Church”* are those who are identified as *“belonging to the Lord.”*

**New Testament Word Pictures**

- New Testament word pictures tell us much about our Savior and about ourselves.
- They focus on our relationship with Jesus Christ and of our role in this world.
- Perhaps you have seen some of these pictures in the past and have thought of them only on a personal level, of your own relationship to Jesus.
- The things that are true about the individual disciple are generally true about the Church.

**Eleven Pictures into Four Groups**

- We will look at eleven of the word pictures in the New Testament that relate to the Church. (There are certainly more) I have separated these eleven pictures into four groups.
- The first group speaks of the Connection to our Savior. Here, the Church is pictured as:
    - A Flock of Sheep with a Shepherd
    - Branches on a Vine
    - A New Creature/Creation with the Last Adam
- The second group speaks of the Intimacy with our Savior. Here, the Church is pictured as:
    - A body with a Head
    - A bride with a Bridegroom
    - A household or family with a Father
- The third group speaks of the Influence we have through our Savior. Here, the Church is pictured as:
    - Citizens of a Kingdom
    - Salt of the earth
    - Light in the world
- The fourth group speaks of the Worship we give to our Savior. Here, the Church is pictured as:
    - A building or temple for worship
    - A group of priests serving God
- We will start by looking at the first of the three pictures that speak of the Connection to our Savior.

**The Shepherd and the Flock of Sheep**

- **John 10:1-18, 25-30; Acts 20:28-31; 1 Peter 5:1-4**
- The BIG picture here is of our Savior’s protection and of our following the Lord, as a Shepherd. This is a consistent theme throughout the Scriptures.
- In John 10 for instance, Jesus declares Himself *“the Good Shepherd”* and the true Shepherd who enters the sheepfold by the door.
- Jesus changes the picture for a moment and declares that He Himself is the door. Then He returns to the original picture, where the doorkeeper grants Him entry.
- There is further evidence of His legitimacy as He calls His own sheep by name, they know His voice and they follow Him as He leads them out to find pasture.
- He protects them, keeping them alive forever.
- He also tells this flock that there are other sheep (referring to Gentiles) who are not of this fold (referring to the Jews) who will be gathered into one flock (referring to the Church).
- The sheep face great danger, since they are not known for their:
    - Fierceness
    - Sharp teeth
    - Dangerous hooves
    - Blinding speed
- They are in danger of:
    - Thieves and robbers breaking into the sheepfold to take them away.
    - Listening to the voice of another shepherd, not their own, and being deceived, they willingly follow him (or her) into the wilderness.
    - Wolves doing what wolves do – snatching some and scattering others, because the one who is supposed to be guarding them is not their owner, he is just a hired hand who did not sign up to do battle with wolves.
- The Sheep are not known for their street smarts, so they have two very simple jobs.
    - The first is to know Christ, their Shepherd, listening to Him so that they can recognize His voice.
    - The second is, to follow Christ, their Shepherd, following Him wherever He leads.
- This seems simple enough. However, knowing and doing are too often, different things in our experience.

**Trilogy Regarding the Shepherd**

- There is a trilogy regarding the Shepherd found in the Psalms and in the New Testament.
- In **Psalm 22**, we see The Shepherd’s death, the suffering and anguish of the Messiah.
- In **John 10:11** Jesus declares Himself to be the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep.
- In **Psalm 23**, we see the Shepherd’s on-going care for His flock. In **Hebrews 13:20-21**, Jesus is called the Great Shepherd risen from the dead who equips believers to do God’s will.
- In **Psalm 24**, we see the Shepherd-King returning to claim, that which is rightfully His.
- In **1 Peter 5:4** Jesus is called the Chief Shepherd who is returning in triumph to reward His servants.
- *Good Shepherd* - **John 10:11** - His death **(Psalm 22)**
- *Great Shepherd* - **Hebrews 13:20** - His resurrection and present ministry **(Psalm 23)**
- *Chief Shepherd* - **1 Peter 5:4** - His second coming **(Psalm 24)**

*Those taking this course as independent distant learners will need to examine the other ten pictures and then gather a few friends to discuss and share your insights.*

## Class Exercise

**INSTRUCTOR’S NOTE: PICTURES OF THE CHURCH**

Now, for the rest of this session, examine the other 10 pictures and see what they tell us about our Savior, about ourselves as the Church and about our responsibilities.

Have your students work in groups. How you assign your students is up to you. You can assign all pictures, or have your students work on one of the four groups, or on one picture. Then lead the class in a discussion to discuss their findings.
