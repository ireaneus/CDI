date: 33 - 2000 A.D.
instructor: Russell Richardson
course: Church History
description: Be able to explain the main duties of the church as well as the unifying principle that binds them together. Understand why it is important for believers to meet regularly.
bibleReference: Ephesians 4:11-16 - "And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."

## CDI Notes

**Instructors Guide** *(pg.37-49)*

You will KNOW:

- That the church met in a variety of locations, had a variety of activities in those meetings and a variety of responsibilities to one another.

You will BE ABLE TO:

- Discuss the three main duties of the church.

You will THINK ABOUT:

- Where to find the answer to the question by looking at what the churches did in the New Testament.

**In the Last Session**

- You studied eleven of the word pictures used in the New Testament to describe the Church.
- You are now able to explain the significance of those pictures.

**Begin video.**

**What is a Church to Do?**

- One of the ways for us to answer the question of what a church is supposed to do is to look and see what churches did in the New Testament.
- The Church was born on the Day of Pentecost, as recorded in **Acts 2**. Peter had preached to the crowd that had gathered, explaining what was happening.
- About 3,000 men who believed in Jesus, were baptized and added to the Church that day. **Acts 2:42** tells us about the activities and commitment of those early disciples.
- They were continually devoting themselves to:
    - The Apostles’ teaching
    - Fellowship
    - The breaking of bread
    - Prayer

- Day by day, they faithfully met together in larger, public gatherings as well as in smaller groups from house to house:
    - They met with a common focus as they were devoting themselves to the instruction of God’s Word and the teachings of Jesus, by the Apostles.
    - They continually shared meals and resources, remembered the Lord’s sacrifice through the Lord’s Supper and they prayed together.
    - They were also fruitful in their witness, in their love and in their gathering for instruction, fellowship, worship and prayer.
- These were not the only things the Christians in the New Testament did, or were instructed to do, as they met together. Later in this session, you will spend some time looking at the variety of activities the Church was involved in, the places the Church met and their responsibilities to one another.

**Three Main Duties of the Church**

- The focus on the three main duties of the Church and of each individual Christian.
- First – **To Glorify God** – **Romans 11:36**, **1 Corinthians 6:20**
    - **1 Corinthians 10:31** – *“Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”*
    - In the Westminster Shorter Catechism, the first question is – *“What is the chief end of man?”*
    - The answer we are to give is – *“Man’s chief end is to glorify God and fully to enjoy Him forever.”*
- We are to glorify God in:
    - Our worship – individual and corporate praise and thanksgiving
    - Our witness – individual and corporate proclamations of the excellencies of Christ
    - Our work – individual and corporate faithfulness in that which He has given us to do
- Second – **To Evangelize** – **Mark 16:15**; **2 Timothy 4:5**
    - **Acts 1:8** – *“but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.”*
    - Individually and corporately, we are to proclaim or preach the good news to others.
    - We are to be messengers of the gospel, the good news about Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection, the forgiveness of sins and the hope of eternal life.
    - This is the command of our risen Lord who has all authority in heaven and on earth.
- In another CDI class, Evangelism, Teaching and Preaching, Pastor Rob Dore will help equip you in these skills so that you will be able to glorify God through your obedience to evangelize.
- Third – **To Edify the Saints** (fellow believers) – **Ephesians 4:11-16** is the passage of Scripture that you are memorizing for this class and that gives us the clearest understanding of how we are to build up one another in our faith.
    - Individually and corporately, we share in this responsibility to build up the body of Christ.
    - The provision is made by the gifts given to each believer.
    - The process involves equipping each believer for the work of serving others.
    - The purpose is the building up of the body of Christ in love.
    - The product would be maturity and stability for all in doctrine, life and love.

**One Unifying Principle**

- We can combine these three duties, which describe how we can glorify God, into one unifying principle – Make Disciples.
- The key passage for this principle is **Matthew 28:18-20**, where Jesus commands His original disciples to make more disciples.
- The main verb here is “make disciples” (the KJV translates it as “teach”) and the participles that describe this process are:
    - “go” (literally – as you are going)
    - “baptizing”
    - “teaching”
- We know that this applies to all believers because the original disciples were to make disciples, who would follow Jesus and obey all that He has commanded them.
- If those original disciples were faithful and fruitful, then they produced disciples who would do the same thing – they would make disciples.
- We also know that this command applies to all followers of Christ, in all places and throughout all time because disciples are to be made, of all nations and Jesus promises His personal involvement to the end of the age.
- It is easy to see that the three main duties of the Church are summed up in this simple command to make disciples.

**The Process of Making Disciples**

- Starts with evangelization or proclamation of the good news. We must tell others about Jesus.
- Then, as they put their faith in Jesus, we baptize them as a symbol of their new life and commitment to follow Christ.
- Then we begin to edify or build them up as we teach them to observe, or obey, all that He has commanded us.
- The result is that God is glorified when we produce fruit and prove that we are disciples of Jesus Christ (**John 15:8**).

**Discipleship is not a Program**

- We need to understand that disciple making, or discipleship is not a program – though there needs to be accountability and purpose.
- Being a disciple is a life-long experience, not a class that we complete after so many lessons.
- The curriculum is God’s Word – teaching them to obey all the things that Jesus has commanded us.
- Finally, the process involves a mutual life on life connection as we disciple one another. There will be those who lead us and set the example for us to follow, but in each of our relationships there will be – or should be – mutual, loving accountability.
- Included in this guide under “For Further Study,” you will find notes that may help you.

Now I’d like you to spend some time surveying New Testament Scriptures included in your guide book that will help us expand our understanding of the life of the Church.

**Review**

- Three Main Duties of the Church:
    - Glorify God
    - Evangelize
    - Edify saints
- One Unifying Principle
    - Make disciples

**In the Next Session**

- We will see there is a need for organization in the local church.
- We will see there is a clear Biblical structure, which also includes clear instructions as to the qualifications for those who should lead the Church.
- We will know God has blessed churches regardless of their form of government.

## FOR FURTHER STUDY

Use these notes to help your students to focus on areas of further study.

**Three Main Duties of the Church**

1. To glorify God - (**Ephesians 1:5-6, 12, 13-14, 3:8-10; 1 Corinthians 10:31; John 15:8**)

    - In worship -- individual and corporate praise & thanksgiving
    - In witness -- individual and corporate proclamations of the excellences of Christ

2. To evangelize (**Matt 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Acts 1:8**) Individual & Corporate  
   Authority: The risen Lord has all authority in Heaven and on earth. Christians have authority to evangelize. The essence is, to make disciples.  
   The main verb is, *"make disciples"* and the infinitives are, go, *"baptize"* and *"teach."*

1. To edify the saints (**Matt 28:19-20; Ephesians 4:11-16**)

**Individual & Corporate**

- Provision: gifts to each one /all believers (**1 Corinthians 12:4-7; Ephesians 4:7, 11**)
- Process: to equip the saints for the work of service for building the body (**Ephesians 4:12, 16 – by what every joint supplies**)

Purpose: until we all attain to (Ephesians 4:13-16):

- the unity of the faith (doctrine)
- the knowledge of the Son of God
- maturity (the fullness of Christ is the standard)

Product:

- stability in doctrine & life
- speaking the truth in love
- functioning in love – the whole body

The Unifying Principle *“Make Disciples”*:

- Strongs G3101 - *mathētēs* - a learner, pupil, disciple – translated: disciple or disciples 268 times in 258 verses in the New Testament – vast majority referring to disciples of Jesus.

Discipleship is:

- A process not a program – though there needs to be structure & purpose.
- Life-long not a class – though there are phases & goals.
- Life on life not just a curriculum – though there must be clear content.

*Our purpose is to glorify God by observing the command of Jesus Christ to make disciples through worship, instruction, obedience to God’s Word, fellowship and evangelism.*

**Come and See - Spiritual Seekers to Growing Believers**
In order to become a disciple, a person must understand who Christ is, why He came, what He accomplished and gain assurance of salvation by putting their faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. Then as a disciple, one begins to walk by faith and is willing to seek spiritual growth through God’s Word.

**John 1:35-39** – vs. 39 – *“He said to them, ‘Come, and you will see.’ So, they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.”*

**Follow Me - Growing Believers to Faithful Followers**
As a disciple, one is trained by developing spiritual disciplines in the areas of prayer, study of God’s Word, faithful service and loving accountability. Then as a disciple, one will be equipped for the ministry of disciple-making.

**Matthew 4:18-22** – vs. 19 – *“And He said to them, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”*

**Be With Me - Faithful Followers to Motivated Ministers**
As a disciple-maker, one will take an active role in the ministry of disciple-making - through ministry and service and/or leadership, by apprenticeship and training, continuing to grow in spiritual discipline and character.

**Mark 3:13-14** – *And He went up on the mountain and summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him. And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach.*

**Remain (Abide) In Me - Motivated Ministers to Lifelong Disciple-Makers**
A lifelong disciple-maker will pursue a deeper understanding of God’s character and God’s Word, through spiritual disciplines and ministry, enabling disciples and disciple-makers.

**John 15:4** – *“Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.”*
