- Take a type no further than the real point of likeness or contrast
- If a type is not clearly defined as such in the New Testament exercise extreme caution
- Refuse fanciful and farfetched interpretations of types
- Refuse unwarranted typological illustrations
- Look for Jesus – the Bible is Christocentric!
