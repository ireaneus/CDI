Explore Relationship between OT & NT typology  
From a Scriptural Perspective  
Fundamental Principle of Hermeneutics: Bible is its own best Interpreter / Commentator

**Definition of Typology:** *a type is an Old Testament person, place, thing, or occurrence that prefigures a person, place, thing, or occurrence found in the New Testament called the antitype.*

**acronym PPTO**

an OT example is a type - the prefix anti in this case means *‘instead of’* rather than *‘against’*

1. A type is inferior to its antitype in that it is only a shadow of the real thing.
2. Not all elements of the type have a direct bearing on the antitype
3. A type differs from a symbol in that it foretells of something to come.

Scriptural Foundation for Typology  
**1 Cor 10:6-11** EXAMPLES - TUPOS (too-pas) a die struck to leave an imprint.

Paul begins and ends this passage with the tupos translated examples. In between he gives four examples from the OT of God’s people suffering judgment because of sin.

**Hebrews is the NT book of Typology.**

**Heb. 8:5** EXAMPLE/COPY - hupodeigma (hoop-od'-igue-mah) an exhibit for imitation or warning. SHADOW - SKIA (skee'-ah) a shadow. PATTERN - TUPOS as above.

A type is a example, a copy, a shadow, a pattern.  
It is not the important thing, it is pointing to the important thing: the anti-type

- **Heb 9:9** FIGURE/ILLUSTRATION - PARABOLE (para-bo-lay) a simulation.
- **Heb 10:1** SHADOW - SKIA (skee-ah) as above.
- **Col 2:17** SHADOW - SKIA as above.
- **Luke 24:27;44 - John 5:39** the Bible is CRISTO-CENTRIC

What did Jesus think of Typology?  
Did Jesus teach using Typology?

**Luke 24:27**

> *"And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself."* Then He said to them, *"These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me."*

**John 5:39**

> *"You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me."*

**The Bible is Christocentric**  
The correct way to use the OT is to demonstrate Jesus. He is the one casting the shadow!

**Two varieties of Types**  
**Strong Type:** *comparison of one or more similar features*
**Antithetical Type:** *contrast between one or more differing features*
