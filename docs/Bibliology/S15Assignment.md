## Study the fellowship in 1 John 1:1-2:2

- Fellowship
- Communion
- Participation

1. Study the topic κοινωνία koinōnia

> (which fellowship, according to John's teaching, consists in the fact that Christians are partakers in common of the same mind as God and Christ, and of the blessings arising therefrom).

2. Identify the sub-topic you want to study.

> **According to "John MacArther, Topical Bible"** Fellowship of Believers, The '*with each other*' **Naves Topical** refers to it as 'Communion of the Saints'

3. Study it exhaustively from Genesis to Revelation
>
> - Acts 2:42 *They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.*
> - 1 Sam 23:16 *And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God.*
> - Psalm 119:63 *I am a companion of all those who fear You, And of those who keep Your precepts.*
> - Psalm 133:1-3 *Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
For brothers to dwell together in unity!
2It is like the precious oil upon the head,
Coming down upon the beard,
Even Aaron’s beard,
Coming down upon the edge of his robes.
3It is like the dew of Hermon
Coming down upon the mountains of Zion;
For there the Lord commanded the blessing—life forever.*
> - Mal 3:16 *Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and who esteem His name.*
> - Luke 22:32 *but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.”*
> - Luke 24:17; 32 *And He said to them, “What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?” And they stood still, looking sad; they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?”*
> - John 17:21-22 *I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; 21that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.*
> - Romans 12:15-16 *Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 16Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.*
> - 1 Cor 12:12-13 *For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. 13For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.*
> - Eph 4:2-6 *with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, 3being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.*
> - Col 3:16 *Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.*
> - 1 Thess 4:18; 5:11 *Therefore comfort one another with these words.; Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.*
> - Heb. 3:13 *But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.*
> - Heb. 10:24-25 *and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.*
> - James 5:16 *Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.*

4. Take Notes while you are studying.
>
> - Notice there are subtopics breaking up just the 'Communion of the Saints' some are about the local church, even for those in heaven. Hebrews 10:24-25 state not to forsake the assembly, whereas Gal 2:9 just mentions a simple handshake of being 'in agreement with one another'

5. Write a paper on what you have learned

> **Communion of the Saints** *means to comfort, encourage, and exhort one another while it is still called 'Today,' so that we may not be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin (Hebrews 3:13). In our fellowship, we strive to be a source of support, walking alongside one another in the faith. But also, when we do sin, we can confess them to one another, knowing that mutual prayer leads to healing (James 5:16). We are one body in Christ, and when one part of the body suffers, the rest feels its pain and longs to heal and alleviate the hurt (1 Corinthians 12:26). This unity reflects the love and compassion of Christ, calling us to bear each other's burdens, fulfill the law of Christ, and grow together in love and maturity (Galatians 6:2; Ephesians 4:15-16).*
