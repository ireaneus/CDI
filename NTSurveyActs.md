## II. Introduction vs.1:1-2:4

### **Acts Chapter 1**  
**_In Chapter 1, Luke_** recounts Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances, during which He teaches about the kingdom of God and commands His disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the promised Holy Spirit (*vs. 4-5*). Jesus ascends into heaven, the disciples return to Jerusalem to devote themselves to prayer and replace Judas with Matthias as the twelfth apostle (*vs. 6-26*). **_Christ is presented as_** the risen and ascended Lord, who reigns in heaven (*vs. 8*). **_Believers should_** wait on the Spirit, devote to prayer (*vs. 14*), and prepare for the mission to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth (*vs. 8*).

## The Witness in Jerusalem vs. 2:5-8:3

### **Acts Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Luke_** describes the day of Pentecost, a Jewish feast celebrating the firstfruits of the harvest (*Leviticus 23:15-21*), when the Holy Spirit descends on the apostles, enabling them to speak in various tongues (*vs. 1-4*). Peter addresses the crowd and proclaims that *“everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”* (*vs. 21*). **_Christ is presented as_** *“both Lord and Christ”* (*vs. 36*), exalted at the right hand of God (*vs. 33*). **_Believers should_** repent, be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (*vs. 38*), and devote themselves to teaching, fellowship, breaking bread, and prayer (*vs. 42*).

### **Acts Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Peter and John_** heal a paralytic at the Beautiful Gate, a location that contrasts his physical brokenness with the symbolic beauty of entering God’s presence. Through healing, he experiences the fullness of restoration, leaping and praising God as he enters the temple (*vs. 8*). **_Christ is presented as_** *“Jesus Christ the Nazarene”* (*vs. 6*), *“Holy and Righteous One”* (*vs. 14*), and the *“Prince of Life”* (*vs. 15*). **_Believers should_** place their faith in His name (*vs. 16*), repent so their sins may be wiped away, and live in anticipation of the promised restoration of all things (*vs. 19-21*).

### **Acts Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Peter and John_** are arrested for proclaiming Jesus’ resurrection and defend their actions before the Sanhedrin (*vs. 12*). Despite threats, they boldly testify about Jesus. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, but which became the chief cornerstone”* (*vs. 11*), and as the only name under heaven by which men can be saved (*vs. 12*). **_Believers should_** boldly proclaim daily what they have *“seen and heard”* (*vs. 20*) and unite in prayer, asking for boldness to continue speaking God’s word (*vs. 29-31*).
