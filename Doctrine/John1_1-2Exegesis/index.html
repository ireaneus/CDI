<ol>
<li>Select a limit and read the selected passage several times.</li>
<li>Look up the Strong’s definition for each word in the passage being studied and
write down noteworthy definitions. Computer Aided Bible Study (notes page)</li>
<li>Read the text in several different translations.</li>
<li>Look up the lexical definition for noteworthy word in the passage being studied
and write down definitions. Use VINES, Robertson’s Word Pictures (RWP), or
online word study tools</li>

anything of note.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="morphology">Morphology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prep: Preposition</li>
<li>3: PERSON indicates the subject of the verb. Third person is the he/she/it/they perspective.</li>
<li>I: Imperfect Generally represents continual or repeated action. Where the present tense might indicate "they are asking," the imperfect would indicate "they kept on asking."</li>
<li>I: Indictative Is a simple statement of fact. If an action really occurs or has occurred or will occur, it will be rendered in the indicative mood.</li>
<li>A: Adjective is a word, phrase, or clause that describes another noun or pronoun and an adjective must agree with its noun or pronoun in GENDER, NUMBER, and CASE.</li>
<li>A: Active Represents the subject as the doer or performer of the action.</li>
<li>A: Aorist There is no direct or clear English equivalent for this tense, though it is generally rendered as a simple past tense in most translations.</li>
<li>A: Accusative The accusative case refers to the case used for a noun or pronoun that is a direct object.</li>
<li>G: Genitive The genitive case refers to the case used for a noun, pronoun, or adjective to show description.</li>
<li>N: Noun A word denoting anything that can be named, usually an object, person, place, idea, or action.</li>
<li>N: Nominative The nominative case refers to the case used for a noun or pronoun when it is the subject of a verb.</li>
<li>N: Neuter The gender that includes most words or grammatical forms referring to things classed as neither masculine nor feminine.</li>
<li>M: Middle voice Denotes that the subject is both an agent of an action and somehow concerned with the action.</li>
<li>D: Demonstrative pronoun Words, such as this and that, used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others.</li>
<li>D: Dative The dative case shows the relationship of an indirect object to a verb, often found inside a prepositional phrase.</li>
<li>S: Sincular Denoting one person or thing.</li>
<li>F: Feminine Denoting a gender of nouns and adjectives, conventionally regarded as female.</li>
<li>M: Masculine Denoting a gender of nouns and adjectives, conventionally regarded as male.</li>
<li>P: Personal / Possessive Pronoun indicating possession, also known as absolute possessives.</li>
<li>T: Difinite Article A definite article indicates specificity. Greek has only one article, which has 24 forms. The Greek article is definite, and it is often (but not always) translated "the". It functions very differently from the English "the".</li>
<li>V: Verb A word or phrase denoting an action. In the Greek language, the verb usually communicates FIVE pieces of information: PERSON, NUMBER, TENSE, MOOD, and VOICE</li>
<li>CONJ: Conjuncture A word or phrase that links words, phrases, clauses, or sentences.</li>

<p><strong>The Lamb of God (NKJV)</strong>
<em>29The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 30“This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’ 31“I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.” 32John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. 33“I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ 34“I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Jesus’ Public Ministry, First Converts</strong> <em>The First Disciples (NKJV)</em></p>
<p><em>35Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 36and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 37The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38And Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What do you seek?” They said to Him, “Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?” 39He said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. 40One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 41He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ). 42He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).</em></p>
