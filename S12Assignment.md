### Morphology
- Prep: Preposition
- 3: PERSON indicates the subject of the verb. Third person is the he/she/it/they perspective.
- I: Imperfect Generally represents continual or repeated action. Where the present tense might indicate "they are asking," the imperfect would indicate "they kept on asking."
- I: Indictative Is a simple statement of fact. If an action really occurs or has occurred or will occur, it will be rendered in the indicative mood.
- A: Adjective is a word, phrase, or clause that describes another noun or pronoun and an adjective must agree with its noun or pronoun in GENDER, NUMBER, and CASE.
- A: Active Represents the subject as the doer or performer of the action.
- A: Aorist There is no direct or clear English equivalent for this tense, though it is generally rendered as a simple past tense in most translations.
- A: Accusative The accusative case refers to the case used for a noun or pronoun that is a direct object.
- G: Genitive The genitive case refers to the case used for a noun, pronoun, or adjective to show description.
- N: Noun A word denoting anything that can be named, usually an object, person, place, idea, or action.
- N: Nominative The nominative case refers to the case used for a noun or pronoun when it is the subject of a verb.
- N: Neuter The gender that includes most words or grammatical forms referring to things classed as neither masculine nor feminine.
- M: Middle voice Denotes that the subject is both an agent of an action and somehow concerned with the action.
- D: Demonstrative pronoun Words, such as this and that, used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others.
- D: Dative The dative case shows the relationship of an indirect object to a verb, often found inside a prepositional phrase.
- S: Sincular Denoting one person or thing.
- F: Feminine Denoting a gender of nouns and adjectives, conventionally regarded as female.
- M: Masculine Denoting a gender of nouns and adjectives, conventionally regarded as male.
- P: Personal / Possessive Pronoun indicating possession, also known as absolute possessives.
- T: Difinite Article A definite article indicates specificity. Greek has only one article, which has 24 forms. The Greek article is definite, and it is often (but not always) translated "the". It functions very differently from the English "the".
- V: Verb A word or phrase denoting an action. In the Greek language, the verb usually communicates FIVE pieces of information: PERSON, NUMBER, TENSE, MOOD, and VOICE
- CONJ: Conjuncture A word or phrase that links words, phrases, clauses, or sentences.

**The Testimony of John** *A Voice in the Wilderness (NKJV)*

> *19This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” 20And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” 21They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” 22Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” 23He said, “I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”*
>
> *24Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. 25They asked him, and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 26John answered them saying, “I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know. 27“It is He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” 28These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.*

**Jesus’ Public Ministry, First Converts** *The First Disciples (NKJV)*

> *35Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 36and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 37The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38And Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What do you seek?” They said to Him, “Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?” 39He said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. 40One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 41He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ). 42He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).*

*Philip and Nathanael(NKJV)*
> *43The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow Me.” 44Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. 45Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 46Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” 47Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” 48Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.” 50Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” 51And He said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”*

**Miracle at Cana** *Water Turned to Wine (NKJV)*

> *1On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; 2and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.*
